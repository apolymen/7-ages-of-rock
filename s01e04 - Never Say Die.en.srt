1
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,263
Birmingham, 1965,

2
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:40,228
the manufacturing heartland of England.

3
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,420
In one of the city's factories,
a young machinist, Tony Iommi,

4
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,650
is about to have an industrial accident

5
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,646
that would change
the course of rock history.

6
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:57,638
One day I went in to work and there
was a woman who used to press the metal

7
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:00,220
and send it down to me,
and I used to weld it.

8
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:03,240
But she never came in so they said,
"Oh, you've gotta do the pressing."

9
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,377
So I had to get on this machine...

10
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,766
and of course, the thing
just came down, "Snap!"...

11
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:14,264
and took the ends
of my fingers off.

12
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:17,324
The injury was a personal
tragedy for Iommi,

13
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:20,601
a guitar player on the verge
of turning professional.

14
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:24,987
I thought, "That's it.
It's all over. Forget it."

15
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,721
But Tony Iommi wasn't someone
who gave up easily.

16
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:31,594
He was determined to find
a way to keep playing.

17
00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:36,203
So I ended up making
some tips for myself.

18
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:38,610
I got a 'Fairy Liquid' bottle
and melted it down.

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,438
I fit it onto my finger.

20
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:44,685
And then I sat there
with sand paper just rubbing it down.

21
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:47,584
And it worked.

22
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:52,395
By slackening his guitar strings,
it was easier to play

23
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:54,282
and made a heavier sound.

24
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:01,416
Alongside Ozzy Osborne's
bludgeoning vocal,

25
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:04,340
it boosted the sound of their band,
Black Sabbath,

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,425
giving birth to a new age
in rock music,

27
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:08,674
Heavy Metal.

28
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:14,260
# Finished with my woman cause
she couldn't help me with my mind

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,335
# People think I'm insane because
I am browning all the time

30
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:22,263
We had nothing to win,
we had nothing to lose.

31
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:27,963
We were just having a lot of fun, drinking
booze, smoking dope and getting chicks.

32
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:31,113
It was better than working
in the factory, you know.

33
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:37,688
# All day long I think of things
but nothing seems to satisfy

34
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:43,805
# Think I'll lose my mind if
I don't find something to pacify

35
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:47,677
Sabbath inspired two generations
of Metal giants.

36
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:53,189
From leather clad Judas Priest...

37
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:56,890
It was heavier, stronger,
louder, more aggressive.

38
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,753
It had more of an attack.

39
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:03,243
...to 'thrash' kings, Metallica.

40
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:05,104
We wanted to go out there

41
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:08,982
and just play as fast as we could
and as loud as we could.

42
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,581
This is the story of how 'heavy metal'
grew on to be a global phenomenon.

43
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:16,523
And despite being the music
that the critics loved to hate,

44
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:19,465
became rock's longer survivor.

45
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:22,384
It's the thing you cannot kill,

46
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:26,106
no matter how many silver bullets
the critics stick through its head,

47
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,137
the beast just gets bigger,
laughs, comes back for more,

48
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:34,502
and it's considered very exciting
by a great many young people.

49
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,619
The four members of Black Sabbath,

50
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,590
had grown up amid the bomb sites
in factories of Aston,

51
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,426
close to Birmingham center.

52
00:03:57,128 --> 00:04:01,973
The band formed through an advert
in a local music store, in 1966.

53
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:07,538
We were looking for a lead singer
and we saw this note just saying...

54
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:09,708
"Ozzy Zig requires gig."

55
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:13,978
And I said to Bill: "I know an Ozzy
but it can't be him."

56
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:18,127
I thought, I gotta have a good name
to attract attention,

57
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:24,291
and I called myself,
"Ozzy Zig requires gig".

58
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:32,368
About three days later there was a knock
on the door where I lived,

59
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:35,620
my brother got up and answered the door
and he came and said,

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,427
"Some 'thing' is outside asking for you."

61
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:43,746
I thought, "Oh no!
It's this lunatic!"

62
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:50,463
He used to walk around with a shoe
on a piece of string. A pet shoe.

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,234
I thought he was
a complete nutcase.

64
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,301
More than any group at the time,

65
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:05,051
Sabbath were influenced
by their surroundings.

66
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:11,505
All the guys in Sabbath... they were
hard-core working class guys,

67
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:14,178
from a hard-core
working class town.

68
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:15,454
It's factory music.

69
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:17,802
That's what factories sound like.

70
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:23,919
You could hear
the drop stamp forges.

71
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:28,410
I'd be laying in bed at night and just
kind of like tapping on the head board,

72
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:31,656
like...

73
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,051
You know, putting the extra
rhythm into the stamp.

74
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,077
# Follow me now and you will not regret

75
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,757
# leaving the life you led before we met

76
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:58,425
# You are the first to have
this love of mine

77
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:03,238
# forever with me 'till the end of time

78
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:08,634
But there was one last element
that would make the band unique.

79
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:13,770
We used to rehearse at a community center
across the road from movie theater.

80
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,071
And I think it was Tony or Geezer
said one morning,

81
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:18,310
"Have you noticed?
It's really weird

82
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,561
"that people pay money to go
to the movies to get scared.

83
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:24,879
"Why don't we start writing
scary music?"

84
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:31,591
The idea for a new form
of heavy, scary rock

85
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,712
would come together
on the title track, 'Black Sabbath',

86
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,080
the showpiece of their debut album.

87
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:40,924
Very moody setting,
with the rain and the spooky cover.

88
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:44,438
Just put it on on the headphones
and sit there and stare at the cover,

89
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,435
and get freaked out.

90
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:57,879
When I first played the riff
for Black Sabbath, I really liked it.

91
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:04,659
You felt the hairs on your arms
stand up. I felt, this was really good.

92
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,146
And we knew we had
something different.

93
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,888
When Tony delivered those chords,
I thought they were absolutely incredible.

94
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,955
It has so much provocation.

95
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,923
So you can't help, as a drummer,
just going... just wildly, "Yeah!".

96
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:41,254
# What is this that stands before me?

97
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:58,033
# Figure in black which points at me

98
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,356
When we first started playing Black
Sabbath, people would scream and run out.

99
00:08:03,113 --> 00:08:06,520
Chicks would run out.
People would get scared,

100
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,477
and we'd go, "Our scary music's
working, ain't it?"

101
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:15,957
To me, that whole track embodies
everything about metal.

102
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:20,133
It is heavy metal within
the structure of just a few minutes.

103
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,458
So, with one track, Black Sabbath almost
singlehandedly invented "heavy metal".

104
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:29,440
The response of the established rock
press to Black Sabbath's album

105
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,520
would define their attitude
to heavy metal for the next 30 years.

106
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:38,301
The reaction of the music press?
Not very nice.

107
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,168
They didn't like us.

108
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,677
Oh God!

109
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:48,265
Any reviews that had been
about the album... all negative.

110
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,390
They hated us...
they did hate us.

111
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:54,967
But what nobody,
including the band, realized

112
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:59,561
was that there was a vast audience
eager to buy into the new heavier sound.

113
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:02,543
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

114
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,307
We were driving up to this gig in
Manchester and we had the radio on,

115
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:13,359
and it was John Peel, who used to do
the top 20 albums every Saturday.

116
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,776
And went up to 13 and said,
"13: Black Sabbath"... "What?!"

117
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:21,375
It was just incredible,
absolutely amazing.

118
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,993
The next night we played in Nottingham
we found a big lump of hash.

119
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,617
And we actually got paid
20 quid each.

120
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:33,420
It was like the most money
we'd ever had and the...

121
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:35,002
the most hash as well.

122
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:37,761
It was just like the perfect weekend.

123
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,911
The guitar riff was central to the new
heavy metal sound,

124
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:46,424
and Black Sabbath were joined
by Deep Purple

125
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:48,319
in laying down the blueprint.

126
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:57,358
The riff itself is crucial to
what we know as "heavy metal".

127
00:09:57,393 --> 00:10:00,367
It almost drives it.
It's the engine, as it were.

128
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,399
The riff represents energy,
it represents aggression.

129
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:07,243
It represents force, and it gets
you into a "metal" song.

130
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:12,585
# Black night is not right,

131
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:15,872
# I don't feel so bright,

132
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:19,337
# I don't care to sit tight.

133
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:22,379
# Maybe I'll find
on the way down the line

134
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:28,484
# That I'm free, free to be me.

135
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:35,447
# Black night is a long way from home.

136
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:42,520
Guitars were important because
it's like having a Jag.

137
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,179
Guitars were very potent instruments.
Highly sexual.

138
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,343
Richard Blackmore,
amazing technician.

139
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:53,018
A real flashbugger...
great showman.

140
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:02,701
We were writing songs really
based on our live experience.

141
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:05,304
And playing live was wild.

142
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:07,548
Paice was a furious drummer.

143
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:12,014
And we had John Lord y Ritchie Blackmore
who were just unbelievable players.

144
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,164
And intent on kind of
outdoing each other.

145
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,149
And so the music really took shape
from the live experience.

146
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:30,659
It was heavy, and it was challenging.
It wasn't folk music.

147
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:37,395
After the success of their hit
record 'Black Night'

148
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:40,295
Deep Purple traveled to Montreux,
Switzerland,

149
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:42,710
to record their next
album at a casino

150
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,808
run by promoter Claude Nobs.

151
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:51,621
The night before recording began,
disaster struck.

152
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:55,143
The band were watching Frank Zappa
perform at the casino

153
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,491
when to their horror,
a fan in the audience

154
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:59,710
fired a flaregun into the ceiling.

155
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:05,059
<i>Within minutes the place was on fire
and we were all evacuated.</i>

156
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:09,544
Hundreds of feet high flames and smoke,
when this wonderful wooden building...

157
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:11,095
went up like a tinderbox.

158
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,018
By the following morning

159
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:15,566
the whole casino had been destroyed.

160
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:22,626
The wind blew the smoke
across lake Geneva.

161
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:24,598
It was lying there like a carpet.

162
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,378
And Roger wrote "Smoke on the water"
just as a phrase.

163
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,550
Instead of heading home,

164
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,278
Deep Purple made the best
of a bad situation

165
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,346
and decided to start recording
tracks in their hotel.

166
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:41,756
<i>Gentlemen, here we go.
Take #5.</i>

167
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:44,037
We barricaded ourselves
into the Grand Hotel,

168
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,188
which we were using
as a recording studio.

169
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:48,714
With drums on the landing,
on the hallway.

170
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:53,813
Hamond in one bedroom and the base
in another. Ritchie out in the hallway.

171
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:54,824
<i>I smashed a microphone.</i>

172
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,202
Then the engineer said,

173
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:59,395
"We've got a day to go and you're still
7 minutes short of an album."

174
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:01,971
<i>Here we go then.
This is the one.</i>

175
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:03,837
Ritchie came up with the riff.

176
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:14,648
And that kind of strange
semitone lift...

177
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,413
you know, no one did that before.

178
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:22,524
Rog said, why don't we just
do a biographical account

179
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:23,826
of the making the record?

180
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:25,524
And so, we did.

181
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:28,261
Hence, 'We all came out to Montreux
on the Lake Geneva shoreline

182
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,331
'To make records with a mobile.
- We didn't have much time.'

183
00:13:32,151 --> 00:13:34,859
So there it is, Funky Claude,
Frank Zappa and The Mothers.

184
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,585
We stuck it on the album
to make up the numbers.

185
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:41,425
# We all came out to Montreux

186
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:45,607
# on the Lake Geneva shoreline

187
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:50,185
# To make records with a mobile.

188
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,730
# We didn't have much time.'

189
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:02,165
# Frank Zappa and The Mothers
were at the best place around

190
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:06,768
# But some stupid with a flare gun

191
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,269
# burned the place to the ground

192
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:18,602
# Smoke on the water
and fire in the sky

193
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,724
# Smoke on the water

194
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,259
I think a couple of DJs started playing
Smoke on the Water from the live version,

195
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:32,515
and it caught on,
that's all I can say.

196
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:36,304
It's like public property now.

197
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:39,493
We've become the backing group for
the audience when they sing that song.

198
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:40,906
It's incredible.

199
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,605
When it was released as a single,

200
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:52,828
'Smoke on the Water' sold over
a million copies in the US alone.

201
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:57,936
And its guitar riff became
one of the most memorable of all time.

202
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:06,731
'Heavy Metal' was now
so big in America

203
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:09,291
that Black Sabbath took up
residence there.

204
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:16,061
The group began recording
out in Los Angeles

205
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:19,115
where drugs and groupies
were plentiful.

206
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:23,682
And where serious work
was the last thing on their minds.

207
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:28,882
We were doing everything there...
women, drugs.

208
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,689
Bringing stuff*
actually flown in on private planes.

209
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:34,203
Sealed bags of cocaine.

210
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:36,982
We went mad...
absolutely mad.

211
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:41,749
Black Sabbath's music reflected
their frazzled state.

212
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:46,285
Songs like 'Snowblind' left no doubt
as to their inspiration.

213
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:51,177
# What you get and what you see

214
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,361
# Things that don't come easily

215
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:59,807
# Feeling happy in my vein

216
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,396
# Icicles are in my brain

217
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,771
# Cocaine

218
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,362
Over the next few years,

219
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:08,853
the band got more and more
out of control.

220
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,995
There came a moment, inevitably,
where the well had run dry.

221
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:23,440
The whole frenzied lifestyle had
just ground to a drug induced halt.

222
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,225
To top it all, I couldn't
think of anything.

223
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:29,884
I had a writers' block.

224
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:35,173
And I certainly I... just couldn't
come up with anything I liked.

225
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:38,034
I really thought the band
was about to split.

226
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:41,015
I just thought, we've done everything
musically that we can do,

227
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:42,622
gone as far as we can go,

228
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,107
and that's about it.

229
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,636
In 1973, Sabbath decided to give
recording one more shot,

230
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:53,536
and ended up at the remote
Clearwell Castle

231
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:55,434
in the Forest of Dean.

232
00:16:56,322 --> 00:17:00,692
Got to this castle... it was so
bloody haunted. It was unbelievable.

233
00:17:01,656 --> 00:17:04,427
We used to rehearse in
the dungeons of the castle.

234
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:08,783
And this black shape, just like
walked past the entrance...

235
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:10,223
"What the hell was that?"

236
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:13,203
So they went out and saw this person

237
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:16,304
walk down to the end of the corridor
and go into this room.

238
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:19,015
And they went in
and the room was completely empty.

239
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:21,313
And there was no other way out.

240
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,152
The spooky castle dungeons

241
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,055
proved to be just the stimulus
the band needed.

242
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,978
It sort of sparked some imagination.

243
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:39,354
And Tony picked his guitar
and came out with a riff for...

244
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:40,765
'Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath'.

245
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:42,726
And I just went, "Yes!!"

246
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:45,815
Stuff just came out just
like that then.

247
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,060
'Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath' was the first
song, and then they just came out.

248
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,567
# You've seen life through
distorted eyes

249
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,511
# You know you had to learn

250
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:59,658
# The execution of your mind

251
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:02,654
# You really had to turn

252
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:05,663
It was the most sophisticated
album they'd ever made.

253
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:09,977
There were some tremendously
high points like the title track itself.

254
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:14,381
And I think, technically,
it was their absolute zenith.

255
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:19,799
While Sabbath were enjoying
unprecedented success,

256
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,827
in their hometown Birmingham,

257
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:25,399
another group had watched patiently
from the sidelines.

258
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:32,748
# There I was completely wasting,
out of work and down

259
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:38,494
# all inside it's so frustrating
as I drift from town to town

260
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:41,993
It was exciting for us to see
a band like Sabbath get established

261
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,346
and become famous.

262
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:47,602
That was an inspiration,
I think, for us...

263
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:50,499
to keep going, you know.

264
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,915
# Breaking the law, breaking the law

265
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,597
# Breaking the law, breaking the law

266
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:59,753
# Breaking the law, breaking the law

267
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:02,660
# Breaking the law, breaking the law

268
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:07,395
By the mid 1970s Judas Priest would
take the music that Sabbath pioneered

269
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:08,695
into new territory,

270
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:11,255
and push them into a league
of their own.

271
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:19,654
Me personally, talking as a musician,
I needed to experiment more.

272
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:23,327
When we really got together
and our writing blossomed,

273
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,771
that was the exciting thing.
We were moving on.

274
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:29,398
There were no boundaries really,
in our mind.

275
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:32,931
I don't want to be in a safe band.
I don't wanna play safe music.

276
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:35,149
I wanna be in a band
that is energizing.

277
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:37,278
# When the day is over,

278
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,627
# I like to ease my mind

279
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:42,949
Priest became faster,
heavier and louder.

280
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,523
# With the beat of a heavy kind

281
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:49,890
Priest introduced twin guitar,
twin lead guitar, into 'heavy metal'.

282
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:57,684
And then they had
the soaring voice of Rob Halford,

283
00:19:57,784 --> 00:19:59,388
which was a banshee wail,

284
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:01,886
but committed with
such range and depth,

285
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:03,376
no one else could match it.

286
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:08,759
# And I can't stop talking
'bout my rock forever

287
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,601
We never had a real set plan of
we're gonna be this kind of band.

288
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:20,374
All we knew was we were gonna
be a heavy metal band.

289
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:23,035
With everything that you know
and love about metal.

290
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,924
# So when you get those blue days,

291
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,752
# Here's just what to do

292
00:20:29,852 --> 00:20:32,301
As Judas Priest were
slowly getting established,

293
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:35,869
a new musical force was
closing in on heavy metal.

294
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:40,357
# Oh we're so pretty
oh so pretty vacant

295
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:44,401
From 1976, punk dominated
the British music scene,

296
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,247
with bands like the Sex Pistols

297
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:49,198
demanding a cull
of long-haired rock bands.

298
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:53,028
# And we don't care

299
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:55,745
The punk scene got our backs up

300
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:57,806
and we were really irritated
and pissed of by it,

301
00:20:57,906 --> 00:20:59,838
because we thought it was
a load of bollocks most of it.

302
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:03,607
We were really angry that
it was getting so much attention.

303
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,141
We knew internally
it wasn't gonna last,

304
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:09,560
so we just had to ride it out.

305
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:14,459
We have always been proud
of the term 'heavy metal'.

306
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,321
We've never seen anything
wrong with it.

307
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:20,642
And when other bands disowned the tag,
because it wasn't fashionable

308
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:22,602
we've flown the flag
for 'heavy metal'.

309
00:21:28,377 --> 00:21:30,552
Giving a two finger salute to punk,

310
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:32,493
Judas Priest changed their image

311
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:35,221
and with it the way
heavy metal would progress.

312
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:42,059
What the band's army of
followers didn't realize

313
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,122
was that the look originated
from singer Rob Halford's

314
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,948
clandestine visits to fetish shops.

315
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:51,916
Somebody told me,
"Go to Mr. S in Soho.

316
00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:54,165
"They've got all this stuff down there."

317
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,290
So when we were in London doing
a show I would stop by there

318
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,644
and just went mad and bought
those handcuffs, and that cockring,

319
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:03,324
and this butt whip and this ***.

320
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:05,906
Just loaded it up
and that's how it started.

321
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,028
On stage, Priest started wearing
black leather and studs.

322
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,988
A uniform later adopted by
heavy metal fans worldwide.

323
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:26,659
# Seek him here,
seek him on the highway

324
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,538
# Never knowing when he'll appear

325
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,020
# All await, engine's ticking over

326
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,782
# Hear the roar as they sense the fear

327
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:34,900
Everybody now know
that Robbie's gay,

328
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,723
but at the time, we were blissfully
unaware of all that.

329
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,998
We said, "Look at those
spiky things. That's cool."

330
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,448
# Hell bent, hell bent for leather

331
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:49,187
# Hell bent, hell bent for leather

332
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:55,261
Who else but Rob Halford
could take that look

333
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:58,580
and make it absolutely
part of the image

334
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,953
of one of the most macho,
male-oriented heavy metal groups ever?

335
00:23:03,988 --> 00:23:06,065
# Hell bent, hell bent for leather

336
00:23:06,957 --> 00:23:09,720
It just came about that
the way forward

337
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,190
was undoubtedly the leather
and studs, you know.

338
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:17,611
Just suddenly dawned on us
that the heavy metal army needs to...

339
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:22,194
to don the uniform
and go marching on.

340
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:28,046
Priest actually focused
the whole of metal into genre.

341
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:30,389
They were the first band
to embrace the term.

342
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:32,955
'Heavy Metal', that had a ring to it.

343
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:34,707
That had a sense of tribal belonging.

344
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:37,385
That gave a sense of exactly
what you were gonna listen to.

345
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:43,163
The band's image and music
finally came together in 1980,

346
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:46,965
when they moved into John Lennon's
old house at Tittenhurst Park,

347
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:50,812
to record their classic
metal album, 'British Steel'.

348
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:56,970
I think all of us in Priest,

349
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,928
will forever cite the 'British Steel'
album for us

350
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:03,474
as the... a pivotal moment
for the band.

351
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:05,675
We suddenly came out with these songs.

352
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:12,922
# Living after midnight,
rockin' to the dawn

353
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:20,236
# Lovin' 'til the morning,
then I'm gone, I'm gone

354
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:27,400
# I took the city 'bout one A.M,
loaded, loaded

355
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:34,282
# I'm all geared up to score again,
loaded, loaded

356
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,503
# I come alive in the neon light

357
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:42,388
# That's when I make my moves right

358
00:24:42,488 --> 00:24:44,890
# Living after midnight...

359
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,302
It was quite inspirational, really,

360
00:24:46,337 --> 00:24:48,179
because we were recording
a lot of guitars

361
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,745
in the room where
John Lennon did 'Imagine'.

362
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:54,330
And John and Yoko's bedroom
was directly above.

363
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,645
We woke Rob up one night.
We were playing...

364
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,361
'Living after midnight',
I think he was in the bedroom above.

365
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:02,052
I'm trying to get to sleep
and I hear this riffing...

366
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:05,975
"Oh, God! It's Glen." And I'm laying
there and as he was riffing,

367
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:09,253
I started, "Oh, God!
It's after midnight, you know."

368
00:25:09,353 --> 00:25:10,584
And then that's it.

369
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:17,494
# I'm aiming for ya

370
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,521
# I'm gonna floor ya

371
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:28,804
That simple idea became a song
that now we have to play

372
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:31,880
wherever we go around
the world playing to,

373
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,735
hundreds of thousands of fans,
they want to hear that song.

374
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:39,030
# The joint starts flying when I begin

375
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:41,672
# Living after midnight...

376
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:44,844
Judas Priest were rewarded
for embracing heavy metal

377
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,859
when it seemed most out of fashion.

378
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,698
Their album 'British Steel'
was an instant hit,

379
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,347
and unified the heavy metal scene
around their sound and look,

380
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:57,108
creating a generation
of 'air guitar' players.

381
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:02,397
But not everyone fared
as well as Judas Priest,

382
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:04,716
the old guard struggled
to keep up,

383
00:26:04,816 --> 00:26:07,732
and the era produced
its fair share of casualties.

384
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,555
Not least, one Ozzy Osborne.

385
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,631
Ozzy didn't wanna sing anything.

386
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:15,796
He was getting out of it.

387
00:26:15,896 --> 00:26:18,933
We all were, to be honest,
but he was worse than us.

388
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:21,642
And we had to say to Ozzy,

389
00:26:21,742 --> 00:26:24,680
"We gotta do something about it,
otherwise we're gonna break up."

390
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,599
In 1978, Ozzy was fired
from Black Sabbath.

391
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:34,191
Ozzy leaving was heartbreaking.

392
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:36,699
I really missed my pal.

393
00:26:36,742 --> 00:26:38,253
I missed all the humour.

394
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:42,281
Everybody was really upset and...

395
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,490
crying and everything
when it happened.

396
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,340
Because none of us
wanted it to happen.

397
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:51,101
Ozzy locked himself away
in a hotel room

398
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:54,503
with a vast supply
of drink and drugs.

399
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:58,506
Out of it in every sense.

400
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,599
While the old guard imploded,

401
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:10,244
by 1980 there was
a grassroots explosion

402
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:12,576
of a more hard nosed
type of heavy metal

403
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:15,936
for an army of fans
eager for a new sound.

404
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:20,800
It was kind of pretty obvious
that something was happening there

405
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,002
that wasn't part of the traditional

406
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:26,673
*** in the wall rock scene that
we were familiar with from the early 70s.

407
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:31,869
It kind of prompted a lot of bands
to come out of the woodwork.

408
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,534
That coined the phrase,
unwittingly maybe,

409
00:27:34,634 --> 00:27:36,115
'the new wave of British heavy metal'.

410
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:38,052
And it kind of stuck.

411
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:40,701
'The new wave of British
heavy metal'

412
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:43,005
was led by Iron Maiden.

413
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:48,641
# Won't you come into my room,
I wanna show you all my wares.

414
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:53,056
# I just want to see your blood,
I just want to stand and stare.

415
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:57,572
# See the blood begin to flow
as it falls upon the floor.

416
00:27:57,672 --> 00:28:02,297
# Iron Maiden can't be faught,
Iron Maiden can't be sought.

417
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:07,722
Founded by bassist Steve Harris,
Maiden harnessed some of punk's energy

418
00:28:07,822 --> 00:28:09,698
along with the 'do it yourself' attitude

419
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:12,878
that would see the band putting out
their own first record.

420
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:16,583
To try and get work in the early days

421
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:18,479
we made a 'demo' tape
and we thought,

422
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:23,655
"Oh, we really ought to make
an actual single or whatever. "

423
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:25,433
So we put the tracks on
in a single,

424
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:27,523
and we sold those in a really
short space of time

425
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,000
just at small gigs
we were doing.

426
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:31,637
It really did start the thing growing,

427
00:28:31,737 --> 00:28:35,122
and real grassroots underground
thing going on.

428
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:40,243
# Just sixteen, a pickup truck,
out of money, out of luck.

429
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,530
Their home made demo
got the band noticed

430
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,192
and a five album deal
with EMI.

431
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,630
# I'm running free yeah...

432
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,381
By 1981, Iron Maiden
were the figureheads

433
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,573
of the new wave
of British heavy metal,

434
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:55,922
but for the lead singer Paul Di'Anno,

435
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:59,565
the pressure of
the unforeseen success was too much.

436
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:02,625
We knew, long term, that Paul
wasn't gonna be able to do it

437
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:03,987
because just couldn't keep up with it.

438
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:07,622
He didn't like being on tour
and it was a problem with his voice...

439
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:09,182
giving out now and
again as well and...

440
00:29:09,282 --> 00:29:10,756
We just knew that
his heart wasn't into it.

441
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:13,491
So we thought, if we don't change
it's gonna take us under.

442
00:29:14,258 --> 00:29:17,729
The group needed a frontman
who was willing to take on the world.

443
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:23,365
They found him in the flamboyant
form of Bruce Dickinson.

444
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:33,041
Being young and full
of piss and vinegar, I said...

445
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:37,227
"Well, let's not talk bollocks about this,
I've obviously got the job."

446
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:41,988
I said, "So you have to decide whether
or not you can cope

447
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:44,273
"with a pain in the ass like me
being in the band."

448
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:47,071
"'Cause I'm not
gonna be like the other guy."

449
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:52,296
# White man came across the sea

450
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:56,121
# He brought us pain and misery

451
00:29:56,321 --> 00:30:00,108
# He killed our tribes,
he killed our creed

452
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:03,956
# He took our game for his own need

453
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:06,548
Bruce had everything that
Paul Di'Anno didn't have,

454
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:09,389
he had rage, he had depth,
he could sing,

455
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:12,350
and he had a charisma
that wasn't born off the streets,

456
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,918
it was actually born
of being of stage craft.

457
00:30:15,018 --> 00:30:19,143
So Dickinson came in and lifted
Maiden to a new level.

458
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,973
# Riding through dustclouds
and barren wastes

459
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:27,987
# Galloping hard on the plains

460
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:31,224
Dickinson brought with him
a whiff of old fashioned showmanship

461
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:33,129
and a keen melodic sense.

462
00:30:36,472 --> 00:30:38,372
It's all to do with
the rising sixth.

463
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:41,628
The rising sixth is a very popular
device in popular music.

464
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:45,332
It's actually one of the reasons
why "My Way" is so successful.

465
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:46,551
Because it has several of them...

466
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:49,567
"And now, the end is near."

467
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:51,300
And 'Run to the Hills'
has got lots of it.

468
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,319
"Run to the hills..."

469
00:30:55,175 --> 00:30:58,846
You put some harmonies on that
and it becomes this huge, big like...

470
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:03,237
# Run to the hills

471
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:09,155
# Run for your lives

472
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:11,989
What make the rest of the song
so interesting is

473
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:17,478
it's got all this quite aggressive,
fast uptempo part.

474
00:31:18,907 --> 00:31:22,273
But with a really strong melody
imposed over all of it.

475
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:24,368
And there was nothing like it.

476
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,894
All the things that Maiden
aspired to,

477
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:34,658
all came together
in that one particular song

478
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:36,126
at the right particular time.

479
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:39,467
# Run to the hills

480
00:31:41,397 --> 00:31:46,367
# Run for your lives

481
00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:59,574
On the back of 'Run to the Hills',
on the album 'Number of the Beast',

482
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:02,085
Iron Maiden became
a global phenomenon.

483
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:07,894
This was the dawn of metal
on a grand and epic scale.

484
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,962
We wanted to make it an event,
basically.

485
00:32:13,062 --> 00:32:15,060
*** with the music,
of course.

486
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,608
But a show as well that people go
and say, "Wow! Have you seen him?"

487
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:21,961
In a word, we were trying
to create something theatrical.

488
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:26,298
# 6-6-6 the one for you and me

489
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:29,413
Metal now took one of
its biggest turns yet.

490
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:32,299
Far away from the factory towns
of Britain,

491
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,908
on the West Coast of America,

492
00:32:34,008 --> 00:32:36,738
a new scene brazenly
announced itself.

493
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:46,869
'Glam Metal' had its origins in the glitz
and glamour of the sweaty clubs

494
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:48,799
of Hollywood Sunset Strip.

495
00:32:50,895 --> 00:32:54,115
You know, the Strip was the place to be
back in those days.

496
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:57,820
Especially the weekends it was packed
with people with...

497
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,616
big hair and big heels
and just glammed out.

498
00:33:04,553 --> 00:33:07,639
The whole 'glam metal' thing
just started out of nowhere.

499
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:08,820
It was quite bizarre.

500
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,109
I just happened to go past
a club and see a whole bunch of kids,

501
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:16,253
about 15 or 16, standing outside.
All wearing high heels,

502
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:18,115
and they had
this kind of wild hairdos,

503
00:33:18,215 --> 00:33:19,913
looking like candy floss
on their head.

504
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:22,685
So I just stood in the line like
everybody else and went in.

505
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:25,276
And just saw a band,
never heard of them before,

506
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:27,162
they were called Motley Crew.

507
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,085
They sounded absolutely dreadful
but they looked great, and I thought,

508
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:35,558
I have just seen the future
of rock 'n roll and...

509
00:33:35,758 --> 00:33:37,113
Damn it! I was right.

510
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:44,187
# Don't you know, know, know

511
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:46,772
# It's a violation

512
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:50,643
# I still hear you saying

513
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,307
# Such a perfect, perfect night

514
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,339
We were wearing women stilettos
and our hair was hairsprayed up.

515
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:04,848
Our whole thing was about living
large and girls and cars

516
00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:07,758
and motorcycles and fun.

517
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:09,357
# Take me to the top

518
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:13,794
We were there for people
to forget their problems

519
00:34:13,894 --> 00:34:15,545
and enjoy the entertainment.

520
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,221
When MTV was launched, in 1981,

521
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:24,328
the network soon found
that videos of Motley Crew

522
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:28,104
with their cartoon image,
were ideal for entertaining viewers.

523
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,341
# Now listen up

524
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:35,075
# She's razor sharp

525
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:39,046
# If she don't get her way

526
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:42,349
# She'll slice you apart

527
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:46,183
The first video that MTV played
was 'Looks that Kill'.

528
00:34:46,283 --> 00:34:51,369
And it was the old goofy production
with girls and flames and all this stuff.

529
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,519
That's when it really took off.

530
00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:05,421
So Motley Crew had gone in a flash,
in one year, from being

531
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:10,076
a little indy band that nobody knew
about to being a major label act.

532
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,659
# She's got looks that kill

533
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,918
# Now she's bulletproof

534
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:18,404
They were iconic... They sort
of defined that look.

535
00:35:18,504 --> 00:35:19,930
That's what heavy metal became.

536
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,208
It became the entertainers,
the pretty boys, selling records

537
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:26,223
attracting girls...
sex, drugs and rock 'n roll thing.

538
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:30,296
And that went on to define
metal for the next five or six years.

539
00:35:32,203 --> 00:35:34,202
The band who invented 'hair metal'

540
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:36,392
became as well known
for their off stage antics

541
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:38,068
as they were for their music.

542
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:42,657
A fact not lost for one of
heavy metal's founding fathers,

543
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:47,111
who was busy resurrecting his career
and on tour with Motley Crew.

544
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:52,942
I think that was the beginning
of our infamy and debauchery.

545
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,218
Because some of the stories that came
out of that time were pretty crazy

546
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:59,641
because we were all
out of our minds.

547
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:02,864
He rode on our bus
and he would just...

548
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:05,743
drink and do drugs,
and just get crazy.

549
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,101
Motley Crew say something
about the fact

550
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,290
that I snorted
a line of ants one time.

551
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,743
And I have got absolutely
no recollection of doing that.

552
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:24,766
It was like kind of trying
to outdo each other.

553
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,184
And Nicky snorted some ants,
so Ozzy snorted these ants,

554
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:34,622
but Ozzy peed on himself
and then licked up the pee.

555
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:36,499
So he won.

556
00:36:37,003 --> 00:36:39,723
# All aboard!

557
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,088
Despite all of his recreational pursuits

558
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:49,621
Ozzy Osborne made the most unexpected
comeback in rock history.

559
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,303
Ozzy was resuscitated
by Sharon Arden.

560
00:36:57,503 --> 00:37:01,085
Sharon was the daughter of
Black Sabbath's notorious manager,

561
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,285
Don Arden.

562
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:09,649
Sharon needed an entree to
the serious aspect of the music business.

563
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:11,701
She was tired of working
for her father.

564
00:37:11,736 --> 00:37:13,681
She wanted to do
her own thing.

565
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:16,813
Ozzy didn't have a clue
of what was going on,

566
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,580
and needed someone to tell him.

567
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:22,907
The stroke of luck they had was

568
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:27,294
Sharon discovered a 22 year-old guitarist
by the name of Randy Rhoads

569
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:32,384
who happened to be the new
greatest guitarist in the world.

570
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:39,861
She teemed them up together

571
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:45,962
and Ozzy's solo career
took of with a bang.

572
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:53,380
# Crazy, but that's how it goes

573
00:37:55,526 --> 00:38:01,066
# Millions of people living as foes

574
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:07,556
# Maybe, it's not too late

575
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,889
# To learn how to love

576
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:15,139
# And forget how to hate

577
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,183
I had the wonderful experience
of meeting Randy Rhoads

578
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:20,836
who was a music teacher.

579
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:24,116
And he was very patient
with me.

580
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:29,036
# I'm going off the rails
on a crazy train

581
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:34,391
Sabbath would go, here's some music.
Put some vocals on that.

582
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:38,093
Whereas Randy would go to me,
"Maybe we could try this key."

583
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:41,004
I had never experienced that before.

584
00:38:41,713 --> 00:38:44,441
Randy Rhoads was an amazing
guitar player.

585
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:47,523
Great looking guy,
fantastic on stage.

586
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:51,921
And there's no question that those
records that he made with Ozzy

587
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:56,310
are probably the best that
Ozzy has made as a solo artist.

588
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:03,747
# Mr. Crowley, what went on
in your head

589
00:39:05,914 --> 00:39:13,814
# Mr. Crowley,
did you talk to the dead

590
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:18,078
But sadly, Ozzy's
partnership with Randy Rhoads

591
00:39:18,178 --> 00:39:19,874
was brought to an abrupt end.

592
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,974
Randy and two members
of Ozzy's road crew

593
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:29,830
were killed when a joy ride
in a private plane went badly wrong.

594
00:39:31,178 --> 00:39:36,236
The effect his death had on Ozzy
and Sharon was devastating.

595
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:38,038
For a start they saw it happen.

596
00:39:38,238 --> 00:39:40,314
They were standing by the side
of the tour bus

597
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:43,703
when they actually saw the plane
go over their heads

598
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,360
and into the ground.

599
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,336
As far as Ozzy was concerned
it was the end of his career.

600
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:51,956
Absolutely. That was it.
Finito.

601
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:58,357
Sharon, being made of
much, much tougher stuff,

602
00:39:58,457 --> 00:40:00,221
she dragged him back
from the abyss.

603
00:40:01,213 --> 00:40:03,732
"You will go back out
on the fucking road."

604
00:40:03,832 --> 00:40:05,972
Literally pushing him out
on stage.

605
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:09,660
Sharon said to me,
"Here's a cordless mike,

606
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:11,006
"there's the stage.
Work the stage."

607
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:12,493
And I'm going...

608
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:16,798
Because my mike stand was my little
place where I could hold on to.

609
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,646
Now I've got a cordless mike,
she boots me off the backside

610
00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:22,216
and says, "Work the stage.
Work that audience."

611
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,957
And it was like the biggest
shock of my life.

612
00:40:25,183 --> 00:40:27,119
And then I started
to have fun with it.

613
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:32,798
Throughout the 80s, Ozzy's
shows attracted huge crowds,

614
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:37,267
drawn to the unaffected charisma
of heavy metal's greatest survivor.

615
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:46,578
On stage, Ozzy was the guy
who made you feel good to be alive.

616
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:50,615
He doesn't have much of an act.

617
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,310
And he's the first guy
to admit it.

618
00:40:52,345 --> 00:40:56,022
He jumps up and down,
he smiles, he gives you the 'peace' sign.

619
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:58,387
He yells, "Come on, everybody!"

620
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:06,186
But it's so basic,
and it's so obviously him,

621
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:07,891
it's an honest act.

622
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:11,685
But old habits didn't die easily.

623
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:16,191
Ozzy's success pushed him yet further
into excessive use of drink and drugs.

624
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:21,281
A lot of it is just a drunk
and stunk haze.

625
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:24,681
I mean I was...
I thought I was king of the world.

626
00:41:24,972 --> 00:41:27,840
And I was doing so much coke
and so much booze...

627
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,163
One glass leads to two,
two leads to four...

628
00:41:30,164 --> 00:41:31,942
in the end I'd do something stupid.

629
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:39,890
Besides leaving a trail of decapitated
birds and bats in his wake,

630
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,770
during one drunken bender,

631
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,175
Ozzy even managed to offend
the entire state of Texas,

632
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:47,569
while visiting one of
its heritage sites...

633
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:50,085
The Alamo.

634
00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:57,754
I was legless with a bottle
of Courvoisier in my hand

635
00:41:57,789 --> 00:41:59,409
at nine o'clock in the morning,

636
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:00,922
and I wanted to take a pee.

637
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:04,980
So I find this old wall, I believe
I had this green evening dress on,

638
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,292
I'm standing there
having a leak...

639
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:15,245
when this guy goes mental,
this deputy marshal or whatever...

640
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:20,793
"There he is!" And I was dressed in
one of my wife's green evening dresses

641
00:42:20,828 --> 00:42:23,178
urinating up the fucking Alamo.

642
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,682
Ozzy's antics didn't go unnoticed.

643
00:42:30,038 --> 00:42:32,843
# Screams break the silence

644
00:42:33,162 --> 00:42:34,816
While his fans adored him,

645
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:39,148
others saw Ozzy Osborne as a corrupting
influence on the youth of America.

646
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:42,929
# He's Returned to kill the light

647
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:48,235
Incensed by the music's explicit
lyrics and satanic themes

648
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:51,131
by the mid eighties, the American
moral majority

649
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:53,752
had heavy metal firmly
in its sights.

650
00:42:57,186 --> 00:42:59,498
Once MTV started catching on,

651
00:42:59,598 --> 00:43:01,973
suddenly this got into
middle of America.

652
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:03,601
And they could see these bands.

653
00:43:03,701 --> 00:43:05,463
But I think sometimes the parents,

654
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:10,092
especially the more right-wing
Christians that were there,

655
00:43:10,192 --> 00:43:11,930
got a little bit upset about that.

656
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:22,621
That particular form of entertainment
has explicit violence, explicit sex.

657
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:27,307
We really don't see
the entertainment value in this.

658
00:43:27,387 --> 00:43:30,784
So many of the participants
are high on drugs, they're drunk.

659
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:33,792
It's a dangerous place
for these young people to be.

660
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,272
We feel it is very harmful for
the young people in the community.

661
00:43:39,766 --> 00:43:43,783
Hot on metal's trail,
was the Parents Music Resource Center,

662
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:46,120
organised by a group
of Washington wives

663
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,331
led by Al Gore's wife, Tippa,

664
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:50,873
who saw to it that metal's
extreme content

665
00:43:50,973 --> 00:43:53,401
was the subject of
congressional debate.

666
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:58,170
Songs glorifying rape,
or incest, or bondage...

667
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,854
- Or sex at gunpoint.
- Or brutality against women.

668
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:05,999
A lot of Americans had been
twisted to think that

669
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:10,427
what this PMRC organisation was
projecting was fact, it was the truth.

670
00:44:10,527 --> 00:44:14,430
That Metal was evil and destructive
and killing our kids and...

671
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,818
all that load of bollocks.

672
00:44:17,027 --> 00:44:19,793
It's sometimes amusing
and sometimes unfortunate

673
00:44:19,893 --> 00:44:22,508
where people will bring
their own conclusions

674
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:26,291
and portray us in a way
that we never intended to be.

675
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:30,612
<i>...a double shooting.</i>

676
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:31,574
<i>Is anybody hurt?</i>

677
00:44:31,674 --> 00:44:34,539
<i>Two kids shot at each other.</i>

678
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:38,537
The moral panic surrounding
heavy metal

679
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:40,813
reached its peak in 1985,

680
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:44,059
when two Judas Priest
fans attempted suicide.

681
00:44:46,376 --> 00:44:50,404
The band was accused of including
subliminal messages in their records

682
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:51,852
and brought to trial.

683
00:44:53,217 --> 00:44:56,730
<i>All rise, court is now in session.</i>

684
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,852
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
Please be seated.

685
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:05,668
What is on trial is whether there are
subliminal messages present,

686
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:10,811
and if so, if they have an effect
upon the listener.

687
00:45:12,248 --> 00:45:15,933
We were just absolutely gutted
about this tragedy.

688
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:21,185
These two guys that were hardcore
Priest metalhead fans.

689
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,730
They loved the band.

690
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:26,068
One literally blew his head off
and his mate...

691
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:28,601
was freaking out and didn't know
what to do,

692
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:30,454
this is what came out in court,

693
00:45:30,554 --> 00:45:33,820
and then he felt he had no choice
but to try and do the same thing.

694
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:39,741
But he didn't take his own life.
He ended up being terribly disfigured.

695
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:43,825
The evidence in this case, will show
that on December 23rd,

696
00:45:44,025 --> 00:45:46,270
Raymond Belknap this shotgun,

697
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:48,391
placed it under his chin

698
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:50,384
and pulled the trigger.

699
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:53,454
Ending his young life of 18 years.

700
00:45:54,143 --> 00:45:55,198
If we hadn't had gone,

701
00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:58,480
we basically couldn't have gone back
to America without being arrested.

702
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,458
We were just absolutely gutted.

703
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,857
Firstly about this tragedy,

704
00:46:03,057 --> 00:46:05,111
and then the fact that
we were being accused

705
00:46:05,146 --> 00:46:07,437
of something
we had nothing to do with.

706
00:46:07,822 --> 00:46:09,879
All this silly thing about
subliminal messages

707
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:11,154
this *** and the other.

708
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,240
I heard the words "do it",

709
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,932
but I didn't understand
in what context or why it was there.

710
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:29,538
Are there subliminal "do its" on the
'Better than you, better than me' song?

711
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:31,025
Absolutely not.

712
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:34,625
In a blow to the moral majority

713
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,413
the court case was thrown out

714
00:46:36,513 --> 00:46:38,944
and the charges against
Judas Priest dropped.

715
00:46:41,122 --> 00:46:42,873
If we had lost that case,
in actual fact,

716
00:46:42,908 --> 00:46:45,536
every record that had been made,
heavy metal or not,

717
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:49,607
every book that had been written
would've had a subliminal message in it.

718
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:51,242
They would have come out
of the woodwork,

719
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,601
and life would have changed overnight.

720
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:57,593
We flew the flag for metal,
as corny as that might sound,

721
00:46:57,628 --> 00:46:59,384
that's what we felt we were doing.

722
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:01,179
And we came through it ok.

723
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:06,845
Not only did the campaigners
lose the court case,

724
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:08,972
they were also loosing the war.

725
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:15,677
Back in L.A., Motley Crew
still reigned supreme,

726
00:47:16,984 --> 00:47:19,794
only now they had lots
of company.

727
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,281
Los Angeles was flooded
with bands that looked like them.

728
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:28,910
It was like rush hour
on the Sunset Strip.

729
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,529
If you would try to walk down
that street,

730
00:47:30,564 --> 00:47:33,195
you were almost asphyxiated
by the smell of hairspray.

731
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:35,151
It was ridiculous.

732
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:36,967
And you would fall over
men tottering around

733
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:38,310
in high heels and spandex,

734
00:47:38,345 --> 00:47:40,411
which actually wasn't quite so bad.

735
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:50,866
Groups like Poison,
Hanoi Rocks and Wasp,

736
00:47:50,966 --> 00:47:53,113
had all followed
the Motley game plan,

737
00:47:53,213 --> 00:47:56,024
and earned multi-platinum
sales as a result.

738
00:47:57,414 --> 00:47:58,852
It was critically and
commercially huge.

739
00:47:58,887 --> 00:48:01,850
This was the music in the charts.
This was what 'Towel Records' sold.

740
00:48:01,885 --> 00:48:04,709
This was the mainstream and metal
had never had that before.

741
00:48:06,392 --> 00:48:08,761
It just became too big,
it became too complacent.

742
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:12,728
Metal always get bloated
and self-satisfied and bored of itself.

743
00:48:12,828 --> 00:48:14,720
And it kind of just sits around
going, "Well, what next?"

744
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,776
And of course, something
always does come up.

745
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,790
This one is gotta kill all the fake
people out there, all the posers.

746
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:35,348
Cutting through the commercial
sound and look of hair metal,

747
00:48:35,448 --> 00:48:37,602
was a radical underground scene.

748
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,532
At the forefront
were four misfits

749
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:45,669
based up the coast
in San Francisco,

750
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,495
Metallica.

751
00:48:50,047 --> 00:48:51,003
# No remorse

752
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:52,433
# No repent

753
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:54,715
# We don't care what it meant

754
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:55,947
# Another day

755
00:48:56,047 --> 00:48:57,279
# Another death

756
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:58,566
# Another sorrow

757
00:48:58,766 --> 00:48:59,634
# Another breath

758
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:00,700
# No remorse

759
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,998
# No repent

760
00:49:02,198 --> 00:49:04,621
# We don't care what it meant

761
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:05,720
# Another day

762
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,053
# Another death

763
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,222
# Another sorrow

764
00:49:08,322 --> 00:49:09,560
# Another breath

765
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:13,542
What was being shown on MTV

766
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:17,460
and what was on the radio
was not the metal we knew or loved.

767
00:49:18,562 --> 00:49:22,097
It was pretty much pop,
big hair,

768
00:49:22,197 --> 00:49:25,102
get on the radio,
get all the chicks you could.

769
00:49:25,202 --> 00:49:27,268
It was the enemy at the time, truly.

770
00:49:27,368 --> 00:49:29,519
We were pretty much
doing the opposite.

771
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:33,992
We always just avoided
all the clichs lyrically.

772
00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:37,289
All the party stuff,
all the stuff about the devil

773
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:39,443
and the sword and sorcery
and all that bullshit.

774
00:49:41,054 --> 00:49:42,703
We were more interested in singing

775
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:46,097
about alienation and rebellion
and all this type of stuff.

776
00:49:46,132 --> 00:49:49,978
Which really wasn't going on
a lot in American hard rock.

777
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:53,542
# Master of Puppets
I'm pulling your strings

778
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,445
# Twisting your mind,
smashing your dreams

779
00:49:58,276 --> 00:50:00,934
# Blinded by me,
you can't see a thing

780
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:03,979
# Just call my name,
'cause I'll hear you scream

781
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:05,149
# Master

782
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:06,389
# Master

783
00:50:07,373 --> 00:50:10,156
The thing that set Metallica off
right from the start was

784
00:50:10,256 --> 00:50:11,205
they were no bullshit.

785
00:50:11,305 --> 00:50:13,198
There was no frilly extras.

786
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:19,336
It was drive, it was the riff,
it was just forward motion.

787
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:23,346
And, certainly in the beginning,
at very, very high speed.

788
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:30,076
Metallica's brand of fast
and angry heavy metal

789
00:50:30,176 --> 00:50:32,061
attracted the label 'thrash'.

790
00:50:39,172 --> 00:50:45,155
'Thrash metal' was just 'heavy metal'
once again taken beyond.

791
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:47,662
You didn't think it could
go any further,

792
00:50:47,762 --> 00:50:50,640
it's now gone way further.

793
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,683
Essentially, it's heavy, heavy,
heavy music,

794
00:50:54,783 --> 00:50:58,213
but done even faster,
even more bleak.

795
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:07,501
The longer your hair,
the dirtier your clothes,

796
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:10,166
or the more street you looked,
the better.

797
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:13,955
I guess it was more...
the more real you were,

798
00:51:14,055 --> 00:51:16,326
or trying to be as real
as possible...

799
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:18,910
We wanted attention
and we wanted it now.

800
00:51:21,905 --> 00:51:25,290
Over a period of time,
Metallica slowly built something.

801
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,324
The were down to earth,

802
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:28,347
they looked like they
belonged on the street,

803
00:51:28,447 --> 00:51:30,443
and had a real sense of headbang.

804
00:51:30,543 --> 00:51:32,207
Which was the thing at the time.

805
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:34,995
Let's get it really headbang
and moshpits and so forth.

806
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,070
For a period of 7 or 8 years,

807
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:41,045
Metallica became the most vital
metal band on the planet.

808
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:48,992
# Make his fight on the hill
in the early day

809
00:51:49,092 --> 00:51:51,055
# Constant chill deep inside

810
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:54,482
By the end of the 80s,
Metallica and thrash metal

811
00:51:54,582 --> 00:51:56,109
were edging into the mainstream.

812
00:51:57,835 --> 00:52:01,119
But the band knew,
if they were to survive the next decade,

813
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:03,060
they were going to have to change.

814
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,143
# Stiffened wounds test their pride

815
00:52:09,824 --> 00:52:11,445
I remember James telling
me at the time,

816
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:14,446
how many times can you be
the fastest guy around?

817
00:52:14,546 --> 00:52:18,919
At some point you have to say,
why not be a little slower,

818
00:52:18,954 --> 00:52:20,371
why not make it heavier?

819
00:52:20,744 --> 00:52:24,503
See what else you can do
at a different speed.

820
00:52:26,454 --> 00:52:28,624
We wanted to get bigger
and thicker sounding.

821
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:32,036
We wanted to sound as huge
as we were live.

822
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,453
Ironically, the sound that impressed
the group the most

823
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:38,584
had been created for
Metallica's archenemy...

824
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:43,381
Motley Crew.

825
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:46,272
# He's the one they
call Dr. Feel good

826
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:48,490
# He's the one that
makes ya feel all right

827
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,121
I take the Motely Crew record,
'Dr. Feelgood'...

828
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:53,697
we'd never heard a record
that sounded that good,

829
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:58,808
that had that kind of size
to the bottom and the base drum.

830
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:00,762
It was just "Fuck!"

831
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,398
This record sounded gigantic

832
00:53:04,498 --> 00:53:08,177
and we wanted to explore
some of that sound.

833
00:53:10,428 --> 00:53:14,136
Motely's album, 'Dr. Feelgood',
was created by legendary producer

834
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:15,211
Bob Rock.

835
00:53:16,915 --> 00:53:20,062
When they suggested Bob Rock,
we went, "Wow! What has he done?"

836
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:22,676
And when they said "Motley Crew."
"Oh, my God! No!"

837
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:25,515
"That can't be, are you sure?"

838
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:28,490
Bob Rock's first task

839
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:32,006
was to get the band to rethink
the way they recorded their music.

840
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:35,778
They built everything around James,

841
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,762
who'd lay down a guitar track
to a click track.

842
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:40,882
Everybody overdubbed everything
and I'm going like, "Well.

843
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,255
"What the hell's that?"

844
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:45,061
"There's no vibe. Why don't you
playing in one room?"

845
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:48,493
Which is what I had done with all
the bands I had learned how to record.

846
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:50,275
So I set them up in a room.

847
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:53,086
With Rock laying down the law,

848
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:57,318
tensions between producer and band
began rising to the surface.

849
00:53:58,874 --> 00:53:59,917
We'd never been in a studio

850
00:53:59,918 --> 00:54:02,275
with anybody telling us what
to do, or how to do it or...

851
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:03,299
challenging us.

852
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:06,702
Now all of a sudden there was this guy
saying, "Wait, try it this way" or

853
00:54:06,802 --> 00:54:09,595
"Why don't you change key there,
why don't you try a different drum fill,

854
00:54:09,695 --> 00:54:11,506
"or why don't you
sing that differently?"

855
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:13,979
That's what I'm saying,
the base should be with them,

856
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,839
right there
doing the same part,

857
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,892
but just not like...

858
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:21,089
We were pretty full of spunk
at the time,

859
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:25,037
and nobody were gonna tell us what
the fuck to do with any of this stuff.*

860
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,294
Working with Bob
on the 'Black Record'

861
00:54:27,394 --> 00:54:30,929
was not without its horrors,
I think, for him.

862
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:32,322
Bob used to be a woman.

863
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,222
I felt like they hated me.
They probably did.

864
00:54:38,696 --> 00:54:41,308
Look what Bob Rock looked like
ten years ago.

865
00:54:41,508 --> 00:54:43,424
This guy is on the side
by himself.

866
00:54:43,586 --> 00:54:46,141
- Is he like the leader or...?
- Yeah, he's the leader.

867
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,779
He told you what to do?

868
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:49,432
That girly looking guy?

869
00:54:49,674 --> 00:54:53,064
Ok, let's rock it.
It's fucking 2 o'clock in the morning.

870
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,541
There's nobody in LA right
now who's having any fun.

871
00:54:56,576 --> 00:54:57,683
They're all in bed.

872
00:54:57,783 --> 00:54:59,592
There was a lot of...

873
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:05,151
We didn't want to give up any
of our control but we knew we had to.

874
00:55:09,156 --> 00:55:12,532
The sound is what we wanted
and he came in and he knew exactly

875
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:14,102
what to do with us.

876
00:55:14,202 --> 00:55:18,728
And slowly became trusted
another seven of years.

877
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:26,099
We wanted to try and simplify
things a little bit.

878
00:55:26,725 --> 00:55:28,148
And as soon as we started writing,

879
00:55:28,149 --> 00:55:29,966
the first song we wrote
was 'Enter Sandman',

880
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:32,260
it was like, "This is working."

881
00:55:36,381 --> 00:55:40,546
It's pretty good but it just needs
a little more... sore character.

882
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:43,558
'Enter Sandman' was to be
the album's first single,

883
00:55:43,658 --> 00:55:45,830
but while the music came
together quickly,

884
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,562
the lyrics were more problematic.

885
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,130
I came in with the lyrics
and Bob and Lars said,

886
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:53,189
"They're not good enough."

887
00:55:53,552 --> 00:55:57,635
And I couldn't believe it, you know,
no one's ever challenged my lyrics.

888
00:55:57,735 --> 00:56:01,265
I said, "Well, ok. There's a challenge."

889
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,027
# Say your prayers little one

890
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:07,902
# Don't forget, my son

891
00:56:08,002 --> 00:56:10,864
# To include everyone

892
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,937
# Tuck you in, warm within

893
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,687
# Keep you free from sin

894
00:56:15,787 --> 00:56:18,675
# Till the sandman he comes

895
00:56:20,259 --> 00:56:23,425
# Sleep with one eye open

896
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:26,657
# Gripping your pillow tight

897
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:30,055
# Exit light

898
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:33,833
# Enter night

899
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:37,437
# Take my hand

900
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,359
# Off to never never land

901
00:56:42,993 --> 00:56:46,664
The rewritten lyrics dealt with
the universal fear of nightmares,

902
00:56:46,764 --> 00:56:49,425
and the beast lurking
under the bed.

903
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,483
# Now I lay me down to sleep

904
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:04,581
# Pray the lord my soul to keep

905
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:06,462
# If I die before I wake

906
00:57:06,601 --> 00:57:10,927
Putting the prayer in there really
touched a lot of nerves with people.

907
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:15,049
That was like the ultimate innocence

908
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:19,302
of, wow!, a child's room saying
his prayers and all of a sudden

909
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,846
the Sandman's dropping this
nightmares in there and wow!

910
00:57:23,146 --> 00:57:24,990
It's so wrong.
It's disturbing.

911
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:27,044
It's not supposed to be.

912
00:57:27,646 --> 00:57:30,264
# Exit light

913
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:34,361
# Enter night

914
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:38,169
# Grain of sand

915
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,368
# Exit light

916
00:57:40,472 --> 00:57:42,498
When the 'Black Album'
was finally released,

917
00:57:42,598 --> 00:57:44,349
it became an instant phenomenon,

918
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:48,453
and went on to sell over
15 million copies worldwide.

919
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:51,713
# Were off to never never land

920
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:54,239
With that one album
they proved a point.

921
00:57:54,339 --> 00:57:57,253
That you could be of your time,
ahead of your time,

922
00:57:57,353 --> 00:58:01,782
but also do it without
actually kowtowering to the suits.

923
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:03,730
They did the record
they wanted to do.

924
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,227
But always bore in mind

925
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:08,344
they could take metal to a bigger
audience, which they did.

926
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:11,142
# Exit light

927
00:58:11,335 --> 00:58:15,018
With the 'Black Album', Metallica
took thrash to the world

928
00:58:15,118 --> 00:58:18,344
and heavy metal into
its third decade.

929
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:22,099
# Were off to never never land

930
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:25,122
Most genres in rock
have their moment,

931
00:58:25,222 --> 00:58:26,878
and that moment
soon passes.

932
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:29,560
The 'Black Album' proved that metal,

933
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,330
never in fashion
but never out of fashion,

934
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:35,111
will always just keep on going.

935
00:58:36,465 --> 00:58:40,209
It'll never die. It's like when
they drop all the bombs,

936
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:42,615
there'll be some cockroach
playing some riff.

937
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:44,142
Somewhere.

938
00:58:51,943 --> 00:58:53,968
