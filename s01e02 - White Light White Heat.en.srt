1
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:35,952
# We don't need no education

2
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:39,554
On June the 17th, 1981,

3
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:44,025
"The Wall" came crashing down
on London's Earl's Court

4
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:49,547
ending the most ambitious rock
extravaganza the world had ever seen.

5
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:52,894
It just always seemed
like a good idea

6
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:56,377
to give people something a bit
more theatrical and dramatic

7
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:59,649
than four guys on stage
playing instruments and singing.

8
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,309
#...leave the kids alone.

9
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:04,567
Pink Floyd were of a new generation

10
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:09,034
who believed that rock had
no boundaries musically or visually.

11
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,717
Everything was possible.

12
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:16,332
It was an amazing amalgam
of different tools in media.

13
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:18,799
Nobody'd done that at the time.

14
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:22,247
You feel the repercussions now... still.

15
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:26,535
# So where were the spiders

16
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,824
Whole new worlds were created as rock
pushed on into unexplored territory.

17
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:37,967
Within arts generally, there's always
the feeling that one has to innovate

18
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:40,705
and reevaluate and then move on.

19
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:42,168
So it happened in rock.

20
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,763
#...and should we crush
his sweet hands?

21
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,914
# Make me a deal and make it straight

22
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:52,348
# All signed and sealed, I´ll take it

23
00:01:52,383 --> 00:01:56,332
Out went the rule book,
and in came a spirit of experiment.

24
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:59,582
As opposed to just here's the voice,
here's the chorus, here's the solo,

25
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:01,395
and here's the bridge,
and then good night.

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,075
It was all kind of... you didn't
know what was gonna happen next.

27
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,619
# ...tryin' to make the big time.

28
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,636
# I know what I like...

29
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:14,756
No longer was it boy meets girl,

30
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:18,388
now it was boy meets ideas.

31
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,054
The gates had been kicked open.

32
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:26,931
It was a childhood, you know,
it was exploration, experimentation,

33
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,557
and sniff and smell everything.

34
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:36,848
From its simple beginnings,
rock had become theatrical spectacle

35
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,627
on a grand scale.

36
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:42,011
This was a musical earthquake

37
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:45,131
that was to shake every
rock act that followed.

38
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,149
This was the Second Age of Rock.

39
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:09,404
It's 1967, and rock music is about
to undergo a revolution,

40
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:12,394
although you wouldn't have
known it from the charts.

41
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:22,918
But then, BMI signed a band that
would change British musical landscape,

42
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,343
# Arnold Layne...

43
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,026
their name was Pink Floyd.

44
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:34,683
# ...had a strange hobby

45
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,812
# Collecting clothes

46
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:46,671
# Moonshine washing line

47
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,551
# They suit him fine

48
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:51,931
Arnold Layne, the band's first single,

49
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,995
was the story of an underwear
stealing transvestite,

50
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:58,437
not an obvious subject
for immediate chart success.

51
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:00,052
# ...a tall mirror

52
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:03,399
If you look, certainly, at the headlines
around at the time,

53
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:05,926
they were saying the "Pinky Kinkies"
and there was...

54
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:09,160
talk of whether BBC was gonna
ban it and all this stuff.

55
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:11,703
So I guess it's part and parcel,
really, of that sense that

56
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:15,036
Pink Floyd was all gleefully
pushing the envelope a little bit.

57
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:16,861
# Oh, Arnold Layne

58
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:19,609
# It's not the same...

59
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,500
Pink Floyd consisted of Roger Waters,
Richard Wright, Nick Mason,

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,243
and their maverick song-writer,
Syd Barrett,

61
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:28,690
an art school student
from Cambridge.

62
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,373
# Why can't you see?

63
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,425
No one in those days would have
written a song like that except for Syd.

64
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,923
I suppose that should've given us
an indication, this...

65
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,828
this guy's brain is rather
different to ours.

66
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:48,077
Syd and the band defined
a new kind of rock,

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,394
psychedelic, mind-expanding.

68
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:56,164
This was rock meets
the Mad Hatter's tea party.

69
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,284
I was passionately in love with the
writing of Syd Barrett, from Pink Floyd.

70
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:06,987
There was something slightly
not-quite-with-us about Syd

71
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:12,003
that really appealed to me strongly.
There was a Peter Pan quality about him.

72
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,470
Pink Floyd's second single,
"See Emily Play",

73
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,352
allegedly told the story
of young aristocrat

74
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:28,074
known as the psychedelic schoolgirl.

75
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:33,290
# Emily tries but misunderstands

76
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:40,949
# She often inclined to borrow
somebody's dreams till tomorrow

77
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:45,095
# There is no other day

78
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:48,891
# Let's try it another way

79
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,077
# You'll lose your mind and play

80
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:57,246
# Free games for may

81
00:05:57,346 --> 00:06:02,027
# See Emily play

82
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:11,385
It had 'hit' written all over it.

83
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:15,848
Suddenly it took the band from being
a sort of underground band

84
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:19,204
and turned them into a 'top of the pops'
pop phenomenon.

85
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:22,358
And that meant that there was
an awful lot of idiot questions,

86
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,579
and an awful lot of pressure
on Syd to do interviews.

87
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,551
Why has it all got to be
so terribly loud? I just can't bear it.

88
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:33,059
I happen to have grown up in
the String Quartet, which is a bit softer,

89
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:35,555
so, why has it got to be so loud?

90
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,443
Well, I don't guess it has to be
but that's just the way we like it.

91
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:42,194
# See Emily play

92
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:44,792
"See Emily Play" was a top ten hit,

93
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:47,643
and Syd and the Floyd
became household names.

94
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:51,030
But Syd didn't want to be
a household name.

95
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:55,220
I think by the time we got on
"Top of the Pops" Syd was already...

96
00:06:55,597 --> 00:07:01,019
struggling with the whole concept
of being a commercial rock musician

97
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,476
rather than being an artist.

98
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:09,247
What Syd wanted was a return to
the band's early experimental days,

99
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,754
when he created musical happenings.

100
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:24,522
Syd was responsible for
"Interstellar Overdrive"

101
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:29,079
which was improvised, lengthy,
no lyrics, atmospheric,

102
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:35,248
and actually ran through a whole
series of musical ideas in one piece.

103
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:40,270
"Interstellar Overdrive" became
the centerpiece of the band's live show,

104
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,272
it lasted anything
from 10 to 30 minutes.

105
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:49,737
It's built like a piece
of experimental music.

106
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:53,499
These four musicians, even the drummer,
really are just exploring and seeing

107
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:54,857
what they could do.

108
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,263
So it's rock music,
but it's not rock music

109
00:07:57,363 --> 00:08:01,093
really as it'd been understood
as rock music prior to that point.

110
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,004
There are analogies
you can draw between that

111
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,603
and what the Velvet Underground
were doing at that point in New York.

112
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:28,098
The Velvet Underground were
testing the limits of rock

113
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:30,627
in a way no other band
had ever dared.

114
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:34,462
# White light, White light
goin' messin' up my mind

115
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:38,489
# White light, and don't you know
its gonna make me go blind

116
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,193
# White heat, aww white heat
it tickle me down to my toes

117
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:46,198
# White light, Ooo have mercy
while I'll have it goodness knows

118
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:49,792
# White light, White light
goin' messin' up my brain

119
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:53,699
# White light, Aww white light
its gonna drive me insane

120
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,602
# White heat, Aww white heat
it tickle me down to my toes

121
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:01,750
# White light, Aww white light
I said now goodness knows, do it

122
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,198
The Velvets were formed by singer
and songwriter Lou Reed,

123
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:08,544
guitarist Sterling Morrison,

124
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:11,057
drummer Maureen "Moe" Tucker,

125
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,875
and British viola player, John Cale.

126
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:16,476
We put three-chord rock
into one-chord rock, you know,

127
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,295
we just had a drone
through everything.

128
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:21,794
And one of the things that the
drone did for a lot of the songs is that

129
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:27,589
it created a tapestry for the ideas
we were very insistent on, breaking rules.

130
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,458
The Velvet Underground used
New York's dark underbelly,

131
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:44,817
with its mean streets and drug deals,
as raw material for their songs.

132
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,790
This was unheard of
in rock music at the time.

133
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:51,714
# I'm waiting for my man

134
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:59,710
# Twenty-six dollars in my hand

135
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:05,794
# Up to Lexington, 125

136
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:09,630
# Feel sick and dirty,
more dead than alive

137
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:14,662
# I'm waiting for my man

138
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,119
There was a big deal about
what we were writing about

139
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:20,043
but in novels it would be a big nothing.

140
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:23,795
It was just really absurd.

141
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:29,785
The godfather of American pop-art,
Andy Warhol, was intrigued,

142
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:34,088
and went to see the band at
the aptly named, "Café Bizarre".

143
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:40,190
# Oh pardon me sir,
it's the furthest from my mind

144
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:42,226
He liked what he saw

145
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:45,419
and invited the Velvets to hang out
and rehearse at the Factory,

146
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,045
his Manhattan studio.

147
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,487
He also decided to become
the band's manager.

148
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,903
We're sponsoring a new band,
it's called the Velvet Underground.

149
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,228
Well, since I don’t really
believe in painting anymore

150
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:02,678
I thought it would
be a nice way

151
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:07,088
of combining music and
art and films all together.

152
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:11,839
And the whole thing is being
auditioned tomorrow at 9:00.

153
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,402
And if it works out it might
be very glamorous.

154
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:18,594
# First thing you learn is
you always gotta wait

155
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:21,785
The audition was provocatively
held at the annual dinner

156
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:25,046
of the New York Society
for Clinical Psychiatry,

157
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:27,360
at the swish, little Monaco Hotel.

158
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:30,128
Warhol had been asked
to give a lecture,

159
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:33,537
but instead, decided to give
the Velvet's announcing.

160
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:36,735
He brought everybody from
the Factory down, including us.

161
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,809
But I don't remember whether we played

162
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:43,324
or people just run around
interviewing psychiatrists.

163
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:48,640
One commentator described
the night as "shock treatment"

164
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,868
administered by the Velvets to
an increasingly nervous group of shrinks.

165
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,668
# I'm waiting for my man

166
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:03,537
With Warhol now in charge of the asylum
he landed the Velvets a recording deal,

167
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:09,001
but insisted on adding his new discovery,
German singer, Nico, to the line-up.

168
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:21,641
# And what costume shall
the poor girl wear

169
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:29,869
# To all tomorrow's parties

170
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:31,379
Andy made everything possible.

171
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:36,728
I don't know if I ever would've been able
to keep writing what I was writing

172
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:40,034
if it hadn't been for Andy and his...

173
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:43,468
umbrella of protection
and his approval.

174
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:47,837
When we got a record contract,
which was really based on him,

175
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:52,070
I could write whatever
and they wouldn't change it

176
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,674
or try to change it
because Andy was there.

177
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,953
There was no problem with the songs
or what they were about

178
00:12:56,988 --> 00:13:00,523
because the people of the record
company couldn't stand the music,

179
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:02,814
they wouldn't listen to
the records in the first place.

180
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,433
And in the studio, the engineers
didn't like it, they would leave.

181
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:10,112
And say, "I don't have to listen
to this shit."

182
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,862
In late 1966, the band recorded
their debut album...

183
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,638
in just two days.

184
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,041
During the Velvet's
stay at the Factory,

185
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:23,785
the band became part of Warhol's
traveling circus

186
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:27,132
known as
"The Exploding Plastic Inevitable".

187
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:31,202
Warhol came up with the idea of
projecting images over the band.

188
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,416
There were four projectors,
all projecting different kind of film.

189
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,771
There were slides.
There was the mirror ball overhead

190
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:44,211
on which was shone several
different coloured pin lights.

191
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:48,067
So, it was swimming in stars and

192
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:51,302
the one wall was covered
with multiple images.

193
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:55,665
And then Nico would stand in white
in the middle of this darkened stage.

194
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,108
The Velvet Underground performances

195
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,737
became the most
elaborate multi-media show

196
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:04,473
rock music had ever experienced.

197
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:06,692
It seemed the very natural thing to do

198
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:08,428
even though it hadn't been done before.

199
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:11,381
Lou and Andy wanted
to break the boundaries

200
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,236
but they didn't know exactly where
that was gonna take them so

201
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,244
it took on the form of experimentation.

202
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:24,936
By creating a total environment,
music, art and film, all combined,

203
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:28,434
the Velvets and Andy Warhol
were to sow the seeds

204
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,641
for the next generation of rock.

205
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:36,275
It was that... The Velvet Underground
sold very few records

206
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,502
but just about everybody
who bought one of their records

207
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:40,950
later went out
and started a band.

208
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:49,167
Pink Floyd's manager, Peter Jenner, had
heard a tape of the Velvet Underground,

209
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:52,095
and saw his band as
the British equivalent.

210
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:55,616
# Lime and limpid green, a second scene

211
00:14:55,716 --> 00:14:59,478
# A fight between
the blue you once knew.

212
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:03,106
# Floating down, the sound resounds

213
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,951
# Around the icy waters underground.

214
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:10,428
Like the Velvet Underground, the Floyd
were about breaking the barriers

215
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:13,121
between art and music.

216
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,206
Lights were very important

217
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:18,319
and encouraged the idea of
what they were doing as being art,

218
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:20,898
rather than just being a rock band.

219
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:25,264
# Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.

220
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:33,642
Like the Velvet Underground
before them,

221
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:37,612
Pink Floyd understood how manipulating
their stage presentation

222
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:40,465
could add to the power of their music.

223
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:49,742
Why the Floyd became
so big so quickly?

224
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,647
It was because what they were doing

225
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:56,270
was culturally and musically
different and radical.

226
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:01,796
In a context of a socially radical
and political time.

227
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:08,039
And when the lights and
music of Pink Floyd

228
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:10,804
were combined with the drug
of the moment, LSD,

229
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:14,271
rock entered its psychedelic phase.

230
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,206
But LSD was also to be the undoing
of lead singer, Syd Barrett,

231
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:25,944
who indulged in ever
increasing quantities

232
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,118
to cope with the band's success.

233
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:34,111
As the drugs took over,

234
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:37,889
Syd wrote about his world
falling apart around him.

235
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:47,133
# It's awfully considerate of you
to think of me here

236
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:52,152
# And I'm much obliged to you
for making it clear

237
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:53,847
# That I'm not here.

238
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:57,725
'Jugband Blues' is Syd Barrett's
kind of last word

239
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,260
within the context of the Floyd.

240
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,545
It's really the sound of
someone going mad.

241
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,821
The absence of structure and the idea
of pushing the envelope

242
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:07,249
by that point
has turned absolutely crazy.

243
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:10,304
So it's about being
disjointed from oneself.

244
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,966
# ...instead dressed in red

245
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:18,738
# And I'm wondering who
could be writing this song.

246
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,473
It's so sort of disjointed and chaotic.
And on a whim, in Jugband Blues,

247
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,433
what sounds like a salvation army band

248
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,734
suddenly sort of intrudes
on the whole thing.

249
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:30,582
If you want to understand
what it's like loosing your mind,

250
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,333
'Jugband Blues' isn't a bad
place to start.

251
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,223
Syd's days in the Floyd were numbered.

252
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,820
His erratic behaviour
led to a group decision

253
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,716
to employ one of his old friends,
David Gilmour,

254
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:55,156
to fill in on Syd's off days.

255
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:02,020
It was awkward, I mean,
initially it was me adding on.

256
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,189
I became a fifth member,
initially, for a few weeks.

257
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:08,137
So that part wasn't too bad.

258
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:12,324
I'd just come along, play a bit,
sing a bit and uh...

259
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,819
Syd would sit there and
play a bit and sing a bit too.

260
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,175
He wasn't really functioning
particularly well.

261
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:28,079
# And what exactly is a dream

262
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:34,328
# And what exactly is a joke.

263
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:42,053
On the 15th of January, 1968,

264
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,882
Syd Barrett played the last concert
of his life with the Pink Floyd,

265
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:50,021
on a faded pier in Hastings,
on the South coast.

266
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:56,033
But although Syd was gone,
he had kick-started a revolution

267
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:59,345
that would take rock music
to a different planet.

268
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:03,026
# Let's try it another way.

269
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:05,935
# Ground Control to Major Tom

270
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:10,510
A planet inhabited by a struggling
young singer called David Bowie,

271
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,371
who'd been watching every move
Syd had made.

272
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:17,425
Syd Barrett probably started
an idea in David's head.

273
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:21,050
He definitely found not only the music
inspirational but...

274
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,680
what actually had happened to Syd.
The way he walked away from the Pink Floyd,

275
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,150
the way he went slowly mad
and retreated into the background.

276
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:32,388
For sure, it was one
of his great, great inspirations.

277
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,813
# This is Ground Control to Major Tom

278
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,090
# You've really made the grade

279
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:43,538
But Syd Barrett was only part
of the mix for David Bowie,

280
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:48,287
as he morphed from one character
to another in his search for success.

281
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:51,418
I wanted to make a mark,

282
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:53,308
and I didn't know quite how to do it.

283
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:56,646
And it took me all the 60s to try
every thing that I could think of,

284
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:59,638
in terms of theater and arts and music.

285
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:02,059
# Ground Control to Major Tom

286
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,190
# Your circuit's dead,
there's something wrong

287
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,767
# Can you hear me, Major Tom?

288
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,649
# Can you hear me, Major Tom?

289
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,843
# Can you hear me, Major Tom?

290
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,807
# Can you hear...

291
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:19,173
# am I floating round my tin can

292
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,915
Although Bowie had a novelty hit
with "Space Oddity",

293
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:24,733
real success was still proving elusive.

294
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:32,072
But then, in 1971,
he went to New York

295
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:35,248
and met a band that would
provide him with a new direction.

296
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:40,493
The Velvet Underground became
very important to me

297
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:43,912
as I felt there was
something so expressive

298
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:46,251
about that sense of otherness.

299
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:51,159
And the Underground were, I thought,
the most incredible sound.

300
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:53,947
There was this sort of mixture
between rock and avant-garde.

301
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:56,925
And the combination was so brutal.

302
00:20:58,352 --> 00:21:02,841
Inspired by the Velvet Underground,
Bowie's first move in the new decade

303
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:05,369
was to create a rock band
with a difference.

304
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:07,138
He called it "The Hype",

305
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:10,306
and it was to be the turning point
in Bowie's career.

306
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:17,040
We played a gig at the Roundhouse
in London.

307
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,136
We decided, let's do something different,

308
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:22,409
let's not just go out
wearing plaid shirts.

309
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:25,001
Let's not go up on the stage
wearing jeans,

310
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:28,864
and having long hair and, you know,
doing what everyone else was doing.

311
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,970
# I'm waiting for the man

312
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:37,278
Hype was much more rock oriented
than anything that he'd done before.

313
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:41,324
And clearly in the songs,
and perhaps in the stage presentation,

314
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:45,605
was influenced by what he'd heard
of the Velvet Underground.

315
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:50,341
Most obviously, one of the songs that
Hype covered was "Waiting for the Man".

316
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:55,693
# I'm waiting for the man

317
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:57,909
But even a Velvet's number

318
00:21:57,944 --> 00:22:01,393
couldn't rescue the evening for
Bowie and his band of rockers.

319
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:02,973
# ...what you doin' uptown?

320
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,549
We weren't even booed.

321
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:08,686
It was really just the most
depressive night of our lives.

322
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:11,552
'Cause we thought we were kind of,
you know, smart,

323
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:14,090
but nobody even looked
at the stage.

324
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:18,401
So it was all to no avail, but that was
a wonderful show inasmuch that

325
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:22,410
then I knew that theater
was for me after that.

326
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,200
I think that this was a very pivotal
evening for David.

327
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,682
It is my theory that this is
the night it all started.

328
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:37,298
Hype was definitely the precursor to
Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.

329
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:45,668
# Ziggy played guitar,

330
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:49,664
# jammin' good with Weird and Gilly,

331
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:52,450
# The spiders from Mars...

332
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:57,907
David Bowie's most iconic creation
to date was called Ziggy Stardust.

333
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:01,176
The character of
Ziggy Stardust himself,

334
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:05,383
this messianic, space-age,
plastic rock 'n roller

335
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:09,964
is obviously created out of many,
many different bits and pieces,

336
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:11,823
and there are all sorts
of different people,

337
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,386
characters real and fictional in there.

338
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:17,011
But Syd is certainly in there.
This glamourous, British,

339
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:19,906
slightly unstable rock 'n roller.

340
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:23,028
And also, of course, Lou Reed and
the Velvet are definitely in there

341
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:27,547
in terms of this very cool,
street-wise rock.

342
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:30,096
# ...and snow white tan

343
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:42,847
# So where were the spiders
while the fly tried to break our balls

344
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,166
# Just a beer light to guide us

345
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:55,316
# So we bitched about his fans
and should we crush his sweet hands?

346
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,936
To immortalise his new creation,

347
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:04,512
Bowie created a
concept album for Ziggy.

348
00:24:05,554 --> 00:24:09,434
The album began with an apocalyptic
vision of the future.

349
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:18,206
The slow, ominous drumbeat
at the beginning of "Five years"

350
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:22,838
is one of the most iconic album
opening moments in rock history.

351
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:24,988
And Five Years is a fascinating song.

352
00:24:25,494 --> 00:24:28,793
On the surface of it, of course,
is the story of society

353
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:31,456
and interaction breaking down
as the news comes

354
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:34,266
that the Earth is going to die
in five years time.

355
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:43,179
# Pushing thru the market square,
so many mothers crying

356
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:52,154
# News had just come over,
we had five years left to sigh in

357
00:24:52,254 --> 00:24:58,425
But on another level, you almost
get the impression of Bowie/Ziggy

358
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:01,207
calling together his disciples.

359
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:05,000
All these dispossessed, lonely,
wounded characters.

360
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,084
All being drawn in towards Bowie.

361
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:11,573
# ...I think she would have killed them

362
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:21,054
# A soldier with a broken arm,
fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac

363
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:25,874
# A cop knelt and kissed
the feet of a priest,

364
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,448
# and a queer threw up
at the sight of that

365
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:33,259
With Ziggy, Bowie now had a vision

366
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,401
which he hoped would give him
the success he so craved.

367
00:25:36,524 --> 00:25:39,548
But there was still one thing missing.

368
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:44,667
# Smiling and waving
and looking so fine...

369
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:49,675
We handed 'Ziggy Stardust' in and
RCA didn't hear a single on it so...

370
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:54,621
they asked us to go back in and
David came up with the song 'Starman',

371
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:57,008
and they thought it was great.

372
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:05,364
# Didnt know what time it was
the lights were low oh how

373
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:09,845
# I leaned back on my radio oh oh

374
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:14,801
# Some cat was layin down some
rock 'n roll lotta soul, he said

375
00:26:17,095 --> 00:26:21,408
# Then the loud sound did seem to fade

376
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:25,920
# Came back like a slow voice
on a wave of phase

377
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,754
# That weren't no d.j.
that was hazy cosmic jive

378
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:34,914
'Starman' made Bowie... a star.

379
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:39,064
# There's a starman waiting in the sky

380
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,083
# He'd like to come and meet us

381
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,591
# But he thinks he'd blow our minds

382
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:48,207
# There's a starman waiting in the sky

383
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,606
# He's told us not to blow it

384
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:52,709
# Cause he knows its all worthwhile

385
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,619
# He told me: Let the children...

386
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,968
Ziggymania hit Britain.

387
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:59,360
The tear-shaped mascara
and a little lippy

388
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,752
had put the glamour into rock.

389
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:04,323
# There's a starman waiting in the sky

390
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:06,656
# He'd like to come and meet us

391
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,752
# But he thinks he'd blow our minds

392
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:13,710
And while Bowie had found his way,
Pink Floyd were still experimenting,

393
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,082
searching for a sound that would
recapture some of the success

394
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:19,171
Barrett had brought the band.

395
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:22,641
We were looking for direction
and we didn't want to compromise

396
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:25,928
the art that we were making.

397
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,808
We wanted to do longer pieces
that were connected by ideas,

398
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:32,493
and that's what we were looking at.

399
00:27:33,036 --> 00:27:34,793
It's just on the first note.

400
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:37,404
- Say that again.
- I went out in one place, didn't I?

401
00:27:37,604 --> 00:27:39,567
With the band's album 'Meddle'

402
00:27:39,568 --> 00:27:42,512
and its 23-minute
extended track, 'Echoes',

403
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:45,360
Pink Floyd found their
signature sound.

404
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:52,386
I was in the studio, playing the piano,
and, maybe it was me,

405
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:54,543
maybe it was Roger,
maybe it was Dave, we said,

406
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:59,307
"I wonder what the piano would
sound like going through a 'Leslie'."

407
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:03,335
- Rick started plonking on the piano...
- "Wow! What a great noise."

408
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:06,346
And they had a tape running
and that is the beginning of 'Echoes'.

409
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:09,348
It's Rick just sitting there,
mucking about...

410
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,847
The grand design of 'Echoes'

411
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:21,631
suited its performance in the dramatic
Roman amphitheater at Pompey.

412
00:28:23,776 --> 00:28:30,871
# Overhead the albatross
hangs motionless upon the air

413
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,969
# And deep beneath the rolling waves

414
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:38,751
# In labyrinths of coral caves

415
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:42,526
# The echo of a distant time

416
00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:46,118
# Comes willowing across the sand

417
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:51,178
# And everything is green and submarine

418
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,897
Pink Floyd, no longer improvising,

419
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:58,262
created a cinematic epic into which
the listener could escape.

420
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,261
# And no-one knows the wheres or whys

421
00:29:01,361 --> 00:29:05,223
# But something stirs and something tries

422
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:10,927
# And starts to climb towards the light

423
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:16,899
The audience feels that they're going
on some sort of... a journey with us.

424
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,849
I hesitate to use the word "trip".

425
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:22,065
'Cause the other sort of trip
wasn't where we were at.

426
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:26,340
Having found musical direction
with the album 'Meddle',

427
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,726
Pink Floyd's next project would take
them into a new level entirely.

428
00:29:34,828 --> 00:29:36,374
'Dark Side' develops what 'Echoes' did,

429
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:38,541
which is taking one
very long piece of music

430
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,437
and seeing what you can do with it.

431
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:43,597
It just so happens that in the course of
that long piece of music on 'Dark Side',

432
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:47,222
you get a lot of great
and memorable songs...

433
00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:48,879
which stand on their own.

434
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:54,363
# Ticking away the moments
that make up a dull day

435
00:29:56,472 --> 00:30:01,627
# You fritter and waste
the hours in an off hand way

436
00:30:03,854 --> 00:30:05,362
# Kicking around...

437
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:09,240
'Dark Side of the Moon', with its lyrics
about the pressure of modern life,

438
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,988
struck a chord with almost
everyone who heard it.

439
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:15,411
It became a rock classic.

440
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:21,961
# Tired of lying in the sunshine...

441
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:24,501
It's really about how
the machinery of living

442
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:30,796
comes between us and our potential
to develop as human beings, and grow.

443
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:35,097
It's about the influences that prevent
our individual development.

444
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:41,542
Although individual tracks
explored money, war and time,

445
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:45,830
the overriding theme of the album
was insanity.

446
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:49,466
Lunacy is at the heart
of that album.

447
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,341
But it would be hard to make
a whole album

448
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:55,698
about the many pressures in one's
life that can drive one to lunacy...

449
00:30:55,898 --> 00:31:00,106
at that point, without Syd
being in there, somewhere.

450
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:06,353
# The lunatic is on the grass

451
00:31:09,156 --> 00:31:13,609
# The lunatic is on the grass

452
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:22,380
# Remembering games
and daisy chains and laughs

453
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:27,938
# Got to keep the loonies on the path

454
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:34,986
# The lunatic is in the hall

455
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:40,330
It's very easy to sing those lyrics
with passion, standing on stage,

456
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:45,080
and it's very easy to understand why
all those lips moving in unison out there

457
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,311
could totally understand
what it was expressing.

458
00:31:48,943 --> 00:31:53,526
'Dark Side of the Moon' shifted millions
and billions of units worldwide.

459
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:56,679
Pink Floyd, once the darlings
of the underground,

460
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:59,901
were now mainstream rock superstars.

461
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:09,210
# And if the dam breaks
open many years too soon

462
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:14,475
# And if there is no room upon the hill

463
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:22,909
# And if your head explodes
with dark forebodings too

464
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:28,343
# I'll see on the dark side of the moon

465
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:31,547
When we finished the album we had
no idea how successful it'd be,

466
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:34,838
but I think we all said,
"That's good.

467
00:32:34,938 --> 00:32:40,622
"We've finally done something
that we can all be very proud of."

468
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:45,972
To complement the album, Floyd moved
from their early light shows,

469
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:49,066
into large scale theatrical spectacles.

470
00:32:50,723 --> 00:32:54,741
# Money get away

471
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:56,091
From 'Dark Side' on,

472
00:32:56,126 --> 00:33:00,916
I wanted to get away from the visual
aspects of the show being abstract,

473
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:04,589
and not illustrate what the songs
were actually about.

474
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,941
And so when we started
using films,

475
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:11,880
it was in order to sort of
drive home the message.

476
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,335
# ...with both hands and make a stash

477
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,118
# new car, caviar, four star daydream

478
00:33:22,153 --> 00:33:26,008
# think I'll buy me a football team

479
00:33:26,108 --> 00:33:29,067
'Dark Side' was really the beginning
of proper staging.

480
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:32,191
A big screen behind us,
in a circular screen,

481
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,390
which was considered to be
wonderfully extraordinary,

482
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,943
we had film running
on the screen behind,

483
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:41,841
and every now and again, there'd be
a few explosions, or fireworks,

484
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:44,194
and in particular the crashing plane.

485
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:51,394
Anything that could be done to add
something to the music.

486
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,000
But spectacular as the Floyd shows were,

487
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,926
the band seemed dwarfed
by their theatrics.

488
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:02,876
Not something that could
be said of David Bowie.

489
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:19,538
On the 17th and 18th of August, 1972,
Bowie embarked

490
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:23,820
on two of the most ambitious
and influential shows in rock history

491
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,487
at the Rainbow Theater
in London's Finsbury Park.

492
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:36,268
To help him, he requested the assistance
of his old mime teacher from the 60s.

493
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:41,267
I got a call from David Bowie's wife.

494
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:47,560
She explained if I would
like to go to London to stage

495
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,837
a show which was to be called
'Ziggy Stardust'.

496
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:53,786
Which for me was quite shocking.

497
00:34:53,886 --> 00:35:00,090
It wasn't the David Bowie that I knew,
it was a very rock 'n roll David Bowie.

498
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,499
# ...we don't talk much,
we just ball and play

499
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,260
# But then we move
like tigers on vaseline

500
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:13,782
# You know the bitter comes out
better on a stolen guitar

501
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:16,666
# You're the blessed,
we're the spiders from Mars

502
00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:23,597
# So come on, come on,
we've really got a good thing going

503
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:27,838
# Well come on, well come on,
if you think we're gonna make it

504
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:30,762
# You better hang on to yourself

505
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:34,403
Bowie wanted the Rainbow concert

506
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:38,403
to be the ultimate expression
of everything he'd learned so far.

507
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,161
David had absorbed so much.

508
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:50,680
He just took so much from
the theatrical elements

509
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,220
many of which I had introduced him to.

510
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,495
The Rainbow shows,
in a sense, were

511
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:05,233
a synthesis of everything that Bowie
had worked on up until that point.

512
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:10,253
Along with the music itself,
there was mime, dance, choreography,

513
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:12,036
there were projections...

514
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,273
# ...five years, stuck on my eyes

515
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:21,520
# Five years, what a surprise

516
00:36:24,374 --> 00:36:26,130
When I saw that Rainbow show,

517
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,212
it was as if a giant window
had opened in front of me,

518
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:34,217
and it was like, "Yes! This is what
the future looks like."

519
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:37,935
No beards, no flairs*,
no grubby grandad vests.

520
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:42,739
By comparison with the standard issue
rock 'n roll show at the time,

521
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,111
this was amazing.

522
00:36:45,146 --> 00:36:49,172
# Five years, that's all we've got

523
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:56,037
David's a very smart man, and he's
bringing in things from everywhere.

524
00:36:56,237 --> 00:36:58,758
If there was music on Pluto
and he heard it,

525
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:01,382
I'm sure he'd work it
into his next record.

526
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,443
By special request from Bowie himself,

527
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:10,868
that night's entertainment also
included rock's newest sensation,

528
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:16,653
# I tried but I could not find a way

529
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:23,929
# Looking back all I did was look away

530
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,184
I think that was such a good pairing,
with us and him.

531
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:30,398
And we were so different musically

532
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:36,017
that there was no conflict
of interest going on.

533
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:41,145
And he was very vocally appreciative
and supportive of all we were doing.

534
00:37:42,082 --> 00:37:45,589
# She's the sweetest queen
I've ever seen...

535
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:49,258
Roxy Music and Bowie were
the perfect combination.

536
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:52,389
Bowie had turned inventiveness
into an art form

537
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:57,061
and Roxy had just released one of
the most innovative singles ever produced.

538
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:02,023
A single that was to prove
a much needed antidote

539
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:04,706
to gray 1970s Britain.

540
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:12,100
When we went in to record
'Virginia Plane', I felt I was...

541
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,449
the rhythm guitarist in
the Velvet Underground, or something.

542
00:38:16,649 --> 00:38:19,593
The whole thing starts with...

543
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:24,418
some 'fuzz' thing with the section
...also on the base,

544
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:27,315
but then when I come in
with the rhythm guitar...

545
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:31,924
# Make me a deal and make it straight

546
00:38:32,124 --> 00:38:34,993
# All signed and sealed, I'll take it

547
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:38,582
# To Robert E. Lee I'll show it

548
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:42,746
# I hope and pray he don't blow it 'cause

549
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:47,873
# We've been around a long time
just try try try tryin' to

550
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:49,809
# Make the big time...

551
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:53,342
That song itself is a kind
of rare collage of ideas of...

552
00:38:53,442 --> 00:38:57,265
almost free association of things
which appealed to me...

553
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:00,710
# Take me on a roller coaster

554
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:04,187
# Take me for an airplane ride

555
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:08,432
# Take me for a six days
wonder but don´t you

556
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:11,850
# Don't you throw my pride aside besides

557
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,972
# What's real and make believe

558
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:19,506
# Baby Jane's in Acapulco
we are flyin' down to Rio

559
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,173
Roxy were radical in just about
every department.

560
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:28,783
The idea that a group like
Roxy Music could arrive,

561
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:31,944
put out something like 'Virginia Plain'
for their first single,

562
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:35,934
and have a hit with it,
that is an achievement which

563
00:39:36,034 --> 00:39:38,978
definitely rebounds to
the great honour of all concerned.

564
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,661
# Far beyond the pale horizon

565
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,958
# Some place near the desert strand

566
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:49,947
# Where my Studebaker takes me

567
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:53,578
# That's where I'll make
my stand but wait

568
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:56,794
# Can't you see that holzer mane?

569
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:59,224
# What's her name Virginia Plain

570
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:05,056
Roxy Music were the quintessential
art school band.

571
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:08,629
Bryan Ferry, the group's singer
and songwriter,

572
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:12,420
had studied at Newcastle with
the English equivalent of Andy Warhol,

573
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,557
artist Richard Hamilton.

574
00:40:15,243 --> 00:40:19,613
He had a reputation amongst
progressive thinking art students

575
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:24,639
of being the absolute guru
of modern "cool".

576
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,754
What you tended to learn from Richard
was not how to be an artist,

577
00:40:29,854 --> 00:40:32,182
but how to think about art.

578
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:37,232
Ferry was the latest in a long
line of art students turned musicians.

579
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:45,886
All the artistic energy that I was
previously directing into paintings,

580
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:51,056
it was all now... all of that impulse
was going into music, into the songs.

581
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:54,292
# I would wak a thousand miles...

582
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:58,005
To showcase his ideas, Ferry formed
a band of likeminded individuals,

583
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:01,956
including Brian Eno,
Phil Manzanera and Andy Mackay.

584
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:05,615
As a collective, they were focused
on pushing the boundaries

585
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:07,696
of what a rock band could be.

586
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:11,690
We did have an artistic vision.

587
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:16,776
We all knew about the history
of 20th century art and performance,

588
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:23,367
and we somehow flattered ourselves
that it could be got into rock music.

589
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:28,478
# Blue suns and grey lagoons

590
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:34,198
# Silver starfish with honeymoons

591
00:41:35,714 --> 00:41:39,679
# All these and more to choose

592
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:43,172
Rock 'n roll was about what you play
and how you look...

593
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:45,882
the whole thing needed a bit
more theater and a bit more fun.

594
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,533
And that's uh... that's what we did,
set out to do that.

595
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:52,848
#... strange goodbyes

596
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,658
In the summer of 1972,
the band released their first album,

597
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:02,580
adorned with a glamourous
50s style pin-up.

598
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,998
Widely regarded as one of
the greatest rock debuts ever made,

599
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:11,028
it was simply called 'Roxy Music'.

600
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:16,487
It was a musical collage of sounds
and moods from the past into the future.

601
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:23,924
Roxy Music were bringing in
all the tone colours

602
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:27,566
of Andy Mackay's saxophone and oboe.

603
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,534
I mean, when did you last
hear an oboe in a rock band?

604
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:46,458
And Eno with his synthesizers,

605
00:42:46,558 --> 00:42:51,344
they seemed both retro
and futurist.

606
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:57,209
This is a 1950s revival show
taking place in the year 2020.

607
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:03,448
# You've got me girl on the run
around run around

608
00:43:03,483 --> 00:43:06,104
# You've got me all around town

609
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:11,074
On 'Ladytron', that's probably the best
example of Eno treating my guitar.

610
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:13,969
If I just play it straight
on this guitar is...

611
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:23,161
which is one of the beginning bits.
But once it went through his synthesizers

612
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:28,191
it sounded like something that came
from the planet Zorg, or something.

613
00:43:30,854 --> 00:43:35,457
# Lady if you want to find a lover

614
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:38,522
# Then you look no further

615
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:41,729
# For I'm gonna be your only

616
00:43:43,532 --> 00:43:48,315
# Searching at the start of the season

617
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:51,401
# And my only reason

618
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:55,936
# Is that I'll get to you

619
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,652
One of the reasons why Roxy
became so popular,

620
00:44:03,752 --> 00:44:07,845
not just with kind of serious,
kind of "muso" types,

621
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:12,393
but with real, high street teen
stormtroopers of glam,

622
00:44:12,493 --> 00:44:17,480
was because they offered this imaginary
world and invited you to join it.

623
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:25,632
# I´ll find some way of connection...

624
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:29,545
Roxy Music, with the way they looked,
the way they dressed,

625
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:32,225
and the physicality they brought
to their performance,

626
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:36,777
that was all the theater you needed.

627
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:49,244
But there was a band out there,
led by Peter Gabriel,

628
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:53,163
who thought they could push
rock theater just one step further

629
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:56,628
when they mixed the sinister world
of English suburbia,

630
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:58,638
with a dash of Syd Barrett whimsy,

631
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:01,296
and a dive into the dressing odd-box.

632
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,431
Peter would put on a hat for
"I Know What I Like",

633
00:45:05,531 --> 00:45:09,086
and would go around the stage
pretending to be the lawn mower.

634
00:45:10,284 --> 00:45:13,091
He always did it in such a way
where people would say,

635
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,184
"What's he doing?
Is that really a lawn mower?"

636
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:20,449
You know, he was never literal,
which was a good thing.

637
00:45:22,357 --> 00:45:24,119
# There's always been Ethel:

638
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:28,756
# "Jacob, wake up! you've got
to tidy your room now."

639
00:45:30,806 --> 00:45:32,990
# And then Mister Lewis:

640
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:38,202
# "Isn't it time that he was
out on his own?"

641
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:45,352
# Over the garden wall,
two little lovebirds - cuckoo to you!

642
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:47,245
# Keep them mowing blades sharp...

643
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:56,938
# I know what I like,
and I like what I know

644
00:45:57,038 --> 00:46:00,912
Where Genesis' music and
Gabriel's song writing

645
00:46:01,012 --> 00:46:04,301
link up to the Syd Barrett tradition

646
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:08,453
is their use of imagery derived from

647
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:14,754
that cozy suburban English banality
gone seriously wrong.

648
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:21,360
The underlying strangeness
of English "normality".

649
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,203
Genesis were formed in an English
public school by Peter Gabriel,

650
00:46:35,303 --> 00:46:37,626
Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks.

651
00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:40,865
They were later joined
by the drummer, Phil Collins.

652
00:46:44,173 --> 00:46:48,750
Their early days were marked by
a distinctly understated stage presence.

653
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:54,833
We were very boring... to look at.
That's the first thing.

654
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:57,606
That's why our albums never
had pictures on them.

655
00:46:57,706 --> 00:47:01,892
And we were very quick to understand
that we looked like everybody else.

656
00:47:03,043 --> 00:47:07,595
It felt I had this huge responsibility
of being the link between

657
00:47:07,695 --> 00:47:11,996
what the band were trying to do
and what the audience wanted.

658
00:47:12,184 --> 00:47:15,571
And I had to, somehow,
get the two to connect.

659
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,438
Gabriel, like Bowie and Floyd
before him,

660
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:24,364
knew he had to reinvent Genesis
to counter the image problem.

661
00:47:24,865 --> 00:47:27,249
His band were in for a shock.

662
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,148
I remember he walked on stage,

663
00:47:28,183 --> 00:47:30,313
and we were all kind of just,
you know, playing along...

664
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:31,492
And it's like...

665
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:33,304
"What the h--? What is that?"

666
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:39,677
And Peter Gabriel comes out
in a red dress and a fox's head.

667
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:44,700
You know, you kind of do
a double take, as if...

668
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,967
as if the next turn's come on
before you've finished.

669
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,212
"Comedians, come on! Comedians, come on!
We haven't finished here."

670
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:56,209
# I've been waiting here so long

671
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:59,845
So there was a deathly silence
when I walked out,

672
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:04,456
and I thought, "Oh, this is interesting.
I'll try some more of this."

673
00:48:04,603 --> 00:48:07,328
There was a bloody argument
backstage afterwards, you know, like...

674
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:10,313
"We demand to be told this thing."

675
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:13,070
We'd liked to have known,
but he said, "If I'd told you, you'd said

676
00:48:13,105 --> 00:48:14,281
"Don't. You can't!""

677
00:48:17,305 --> 00:48:20,237
The next week, Peter was on
the front page of a makeup magazine,

678
00:48:20,337 --> 00:48:23,564
so we thought,
we're onto something here.

679
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,504
With a new line in stage costumes,

680
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:41,510
Peter Gabriel and the band produced
their most successful album to date,

681
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,854
'Foxtrot',
which included

682
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:47,489
the haunting and surreal epic,
'Supper's Ready'.

683
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,829
'Supper's Ready' began with
these very atmospheric chords...

684
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:03,413
and it seemed a good place to put
this story of what had happened to me...

685
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:06,322
a strange and frightening experience.

686
00:49:10,963 --> 00:49:16,350
I was trying to piece things together
lyrically that would tell a story,

687
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,489
or paint pictures.

688
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:26,875
# ...And it's hello babe with
your guardian eyes so blue.

689
00:49:28,026 --> 00:49:33,306
# Hey, my baby don't you
know our love is true.

690
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,229
Nearly 23 minutes long,
'Supper's Ready' was one piece

691
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:39,763
made up of a number
of musical sections.

692
00:49:39,985 --> 00:49:41,090
# A flower?

693
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:45,526
# If you go down to Willow Farm,

694
00:49:45,726 --> 00:49:50,549
# to look for butterflies,
flutterbyes, gutterflies

695
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:57,105
# Open your eyes, it's full of surprise,
everyone lies

696
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,160
# like the focks on the rocks,

697
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:03,446
# and the musical box.

698
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:08,004
There were a lot of elements
of my childhood in 'Supper's Ready'.

699
00:50:08,204 --> 00:50:12,431
'Bill and Ben' was the program that
I watched as a 3 or 4 year old,

700
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:16,540
and there was these flower-pot men,
and there was 'Weed' who

701
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,246
was this big, floral character.

702
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,838
It obviously sunk deep
into my subconscious.

703
00:50:23,578 --> 00:50:27,567
# We've got everything,
we're growing everything,

704
00:50:28,169 --> 00:50:29,052
# We've got some in

705
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,148
# We've got some out

706
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:33,822
# We've got some wild
things floating about.

707
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:37,582
# Everyone, we're changing everyone,

708
00:50:38,197 --> 00:50:39,178
# you name them all,

709
00:50:39,213 --> 00:50:40,573
# We've had them here,

710
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:44,336
# And the real stars are still to appear.

711
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:50,829
In terms of the theatrical tradition
in British rock, I think...

712
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:56,262
the other end of the spectrum from
what Bowie and Roxy Music were doing

713
00:50:56,362 --> 00:50:58,280
was Genesis.

714
00:51:00,569 --> 00:51:03,217
Certainly in terms of
the costumes he wore,

715
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:07,028
he took the dressing-up
tendency of British rock

716
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:10,622
several stages beyond even
where Bowie had gone.

717
00:51:10,722 --> 00:51:13,918
By comparison with some of the stuff
Gabriel wore on stage,

718
00:51:14,018 --> 00:51:17,205
Bowie was dressed for a Sunday
afternoon at the pub.

719
00:51:17,305 --> 00:51:20,226
# Momma I want you now.

720
00:51:22,006 --> 00:51:24,549
Rock theater was becoming
ever more elaborate,

721
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:28,344
attracting ever larger audiences
in ever bigger venues.

722
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:32,924
But this came at a price,

723
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:35,971
spectacle was replacing intimacy.

724
00:51:36,098 --> 00:51:40,390
A dilemma felt even by
the kings of rock theater, Pink Floyd.

725
00:51:41,276 --> 00:51:45,436
I famously became very disgruntled
on the road with huge audiences.

726
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:48,220
The audience was just
growing exponentially

727
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,789
and I did feel it all got
a bit out of control.

728
00:51:52,073 --> 00:51:55,187
That we were being
overcome by commerce.

729
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:59,612
I found myself increasingly
upset by people in the audience

730
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,378
just going, "Argh!",

731
00:52:04,478 --> 00:52:08,827
for two hours rather than
listening to what we were doing.

732
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:13,019
Roger Waters' solution
to the problem was radical.

733
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:17,005
He would send up the whole process

734
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:19,832
while ironically still
providing the rock world

735
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:22,881
with one of the most ambitious
shows in its history.

736
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,717
The idea formed in my mind of...

737
00:52:28,817 --> 00:52:31,121
of doing a show where
we would actually

738
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:35,038
physically build a wall across
the front of the stage

739
00:52:35,138 --> 00:52:39,916
to express my feeling of alienation
from that part of the audience.

740
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:44,707
# We don't need no education

741
00:52:49,186 --> 00:52:53,919
# We don't need no thought control

742
00:52:54,982 --> 00:52:59,912
Released in 1979, 'The Wall' double
album became a huge success,

743
00:53:00,012 --> 00:53:03,477
and delivered an unexpected
hit single for the band.

744
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:08,481
# Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!

745
00:53:08,825 --> 00:53:12,651
But not everyone was convinced
by Roger Waters' stage concept.

746
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:17,926
# All in all you're just
another brick in the wall.

747
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:20,186
I thought the idea was crazy,
I have to say.

748
00:53:20,286 --> 00:53:24,065
I loved having an audience.
I thought, it's a bit illogical this.

749
00:53:24,165 --> 00:53:27,108
If you're going to build a wall between
the audience why bother to turn up.

750
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:30,259
Why do it anyway?

751
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:35,625
# No! don’t think I’ll need
anything at all

752
00:53:37,478 --> 00:53:40,647
The building of the wall went on
throughout the whole first half.

753
00:53:41,173 --> 00:53:43,846
And we were gradually
becoming obscured.

754
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:47,636
And at the end of the first half
it'd be 'Goodbye Cruel World'...

755
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:49,704
and then the last brick
would go on.

756
00:53:50,738 --> 00:53:56,835
# Goodbye, cruel world,
I'm leaving you today

757
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:02,420
# Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

758
00:54:04,877 --> 00:54:13,206
# Goodbye, all you people,
there's nothing you can say

759
00:54:13,544 --> 00:54:18,413
# To make me change my mind

760
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:21,080
# Goodbye

761
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,364
One of the most iconic moments
of the performance

762
00:54:28,464 --> 00:54:31,251
showed off one of Pink Floyd's
best loved songs,

763
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,139
sung by David Gilmour
from the dizzying heights

764
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,351
on the top of the wall.

765
00:54:35,386 --> 00:54:38,023
# Come on, it's time to go

766
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:44,684
# There is no pain you are receding

767
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:52,465
# A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.

768
00:54:54,850 --> 00:55:00,146
# You are only coming through in waves.

769
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:07,829
# Your lips move but I can't hear
what you're saying.

770
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:19,015
# I have become comfortably numb.

771
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:24,156
As the show progressed,
the wall became a vast cinema screen

772
00:55:24,256 --> 00:55:29,385
showing satirical animations created
by caricaturist, Gerald Scarfe.

773
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:39,914
The Floyd were pushing the boundary and
I loved the theatricality of their work.

774
00:55:40,066 --> 00:55:44,076
Something of that excitement
got into me and made want to

775
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:48,223
illustrate and enhance them visually.

776
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:07,538
Taking yourself seriously and trying
to make some sort of grand spectacle

777
00:56:07,638 --> 00:56:10,013
had never got as ambitious
or overblown,

778
00:56:10,048 --> 00:56:11,379
depending on which way
you look at it,

779
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,007
as that before, but certainly in terms
of a kind of touring show

780
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,868
that you can sit in
an auditorium and see,

781
00:56:15,968 --> 00:56:18,345
'The Wall' was almost
preposterously ambitious.

782
00:56:21,647 --> 00:56:25,082
When the show came to its end,
the wall came crashing down,

783
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:27,488
only to be rebuilt again the next night.

784
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,168
It was the ultimate theatrical show
that Floyd could put on, that's for sure.

785
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:36,385
Where could you go from there?

786
00:56:37,842 --> 00:56:40,250
The cost of the performance
was prohibitive,

787
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:43,027
and the show was seen
in just four cities,

788
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:45,322
and then only in massive arenas.

789
00:56:46,581 --> 00:56:51,423
Many questioned whether rock
theatricality had gone a brick to far.

790
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:58,164
With 'The Wall', the great irony
was that part of the inspiration

791
00:56:58,264 --> 00:57:04,891
was Roger Waters' increasing distaste
for the way that stadium performance

792
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:10,295
was isolating the band
from the audience.

793
00:57:11,332 --> 00:57:13,741
# When we grew up and went to school,

794
00:57:13,841 --> 00:57:15,853
# There were certain teachers who

795
00:57:15,953 --> 00:57:19,100
# Would hurt the children
anyway they could

796
00:57:19,473 --> 00:57:24,842
So in order to dramatise this,
he created this huge theatrical spectacle

797
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:29,556
which effectively alienated
the band from the audience

798
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:35,717
more effectively than anything
staged by any band beforehand, ever.

799
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,895
# But in the town it was well known

800
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,009
# When they got home at night...

801
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:44,118
Rock music and performance
was now light-years away

802
00:57:44,218 --> 00:57:47,644
from the light shows pioneered
by the Velvet Underground.

803
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:55,372
It had picked up glamour and style
from David Bowie and Roxy Music,

804
00:57:56,521 --> 00:57:58,529
gone surreal with Genesis,

805
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:02,964
and reached epic scale
with the Pink Floyd shows.

806
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:13,321
The ideas and innovations
begun in the 1960s and 70s

807
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:16,925
created a whole new dimension
for popular music.

808
00:58:18,192 --> 00:58:22,455
Its pioneers were
the godfathers of rock.

809
00:58:42,111 --> 00:58:45,005
Next week on 'Seven Ages of Rock'
all bets are off

810
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,615
