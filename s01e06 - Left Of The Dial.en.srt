1
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:45,038
Seattle, Washington, in the early 90s
the music capital of the world.

2
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:49,825
# With the lights out
its less dangerous

3
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,927
Home to grunge, teen spirit and
the kings of alternative rock, Nirvana.

4
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,139
# I feel stupid and contagious

5
00:00:58,236 --> 00:00:59,991
# Here we are now

6
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:02,148
# Entertain us

7
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:03,928
# A mulatto

8
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,693
The band that brought the sound
of the American underground

9
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:07,947
to a mass audience.

10
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:11,939
The moment they took the stage
it was like hysteria, like Beatlemania.

11
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:14,477
People crying and screaming and...

12
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:16,303
The hair at the back
of my neck went up.

13
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:20,964
In Kurt Cobain, Nirvana
had an artist of rare power

14
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:23,518
who gave a voice
to a generation.

15
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:27,552
Every time he touched the guitar
it was beautiful.

16
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:29,096
Every single time.

17
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:34,494
He was amazing. He really had something
that I've never seen in anyone else.

18
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,335
Nirvana's success had put
Seattle on the map.

19
00:01:37,603 --> 00:01:41,184
Now, even the band that had laid
the foundations of alternative rock

20
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,582
descended on the city,

21
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:43,765
R.E.M.

22
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:46,820
<i>Hi, this is Mike Milles of REM
and you're listening to KC...</i>

23
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:49,402
# That's me in the corner

24
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:57,075
# That's me in the spotlight
losing my religion

25
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,318
When REM and Nirvana
came together

26
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:03,751
it would lead to the great
might-have-beens of rock history.

27
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:07,276
I said to Kurt, "You wanna play with us?"
He was, "Man! I'd like nothing more."

28
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:10,023
All I could think about was
what a freaking tour that would be

29
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:13,083
to have us and them on the same stage,
on the same night.

30
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:16,184
But the chances of the two biggest
rock bands on the planet

31
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:17,769
sharing a stage was slim,

32
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:22,201
as Kurt Cobain plunged into a spiral
of depression and drug-addiction

33
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:24,954
that no one could save him from.

34
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,676
I created a project that he had
to flight to Georgia to work with me on,

35
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:35,923
in an attempt to pull him out of
headspace that he was in in Seattle,

36
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:38,014
in his house all alone,
but it didn't work.

37
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,591
Sadly.

38
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:42,859
This is the story of the age
of alternative rock,

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,162
when a handful of bands restored

40
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,918
authenticity, meaning
and passion to the music.

41
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:54,193
And the lasting legacy of the artist
who continues to cast a powerful shadow

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,255
over the whole of rock.

43
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:58,724
Kurt Cobain is the last great rock star,

44
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:03,596
and I think that's one reason there still
remains so much fascination with him.

45
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:09,920
<i>An electrician arrived at Kurt Cobain's
luxurious home early in the morning.</i>

46
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:12,323
<i>... we need to notify the family.</i>

47
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,036
<i>Apparently it was a suicide
at the age of 27.</i>

48
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,636
In the 1980s,
Ronald Reagan's presidency

49
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:27,410
served up an American dream
of growth and prosperity

50
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:29,313
for some.

51
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,725
<i>It's morning again in America.</i>

52
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:34,278
<i>Today more men and women
will go to work</i>

53
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,450
<i>than ever before
in our country's history.</i>

54
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,796
<i>Now you have
everything you wanted.</i>

55
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,281
<i>Including you?</i>

56
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:45,204
Unless you voted for Reagan,

57
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,925
you didn't have
a great time under Reagan.

58
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:53,178
It's morning in America for people
who contributed to that campaign,

59
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,117
who shared those ideals.

60
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:57,255
It wasn't morning in America
for anyone else.

61
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:58,927
It was like the sun
had just set.

62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,472
# It's the end of the world
as we know it

63
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:06,146
# and I feel fine

64
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:11,116
There was an immense frustration
in the country that was palpable

65
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:15,010
and we certainly shared it
as political activists, as people who...

66
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:20,639
felt like the very idea of America
was being pulled out from under us.

67
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:24,207
# The other night I dreamt of knives,

68
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:26,486
# continental drift divide.
Mountains sit in a line

69
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:27,967
# Leonard Bernstein...

70
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:31,872
Reaganomics delivered shock
treatment to the American economy,

71
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:35,892
sweeping aside the idealism
values of the 1960s.

72
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:41,478
Those unable or unwilling to conform
were in for a rough ride.

73
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,551
We got no prospects,

74
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:51,231
you know, what are you gonna do,
work at McDonalds? Deliver papers?

75
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:54,094
You feel like not only
are you in a minority

76
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,836
but you feel like you're in
a minority nobody gives a shit about.

77
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:04,842
# Well a person can work up
a mean mean thirst

78
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:10,377
# After a hard day
of nothin' much at all

79
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,901
In the depressed logging town
of Aberdeen in Washington St.,

80
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,730
Kurt Cobain was part
of that minority.

81
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:19,396
A high-school dropout
from a broken home,

82
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:24,588
Kurt entered a downsize world
of dead end jobs in 1985.

83
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:27,243
He ended up getting a job
back at the high school

84
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:30,542
that he had dropped out of.
He was the janitor.

85
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,821
So you can imagine the shame
that he must have felt of

86
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:38,636
coming in the halls and seeing kids that
were his classmates just months before,

87
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:42,695
and they're going off to college
and what he's doing is mopping the floor.

88
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:46,190
Kurt's experience was not unique.

89
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:50,208
He was part of "Generation X",
children who felt alienated

90
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:53,104
and excluded from
conventional society,

91
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:55,009
who would never enjoy the prospects

92
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,141
their baby-boomer parents
had taken for granted.

93
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,675
Kurt would find a soulmate in Aberdeen,

94
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:05,106
who shared a similar
background and outlook,

95
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:07,556
Krist Novoselic.

96
00:06:07,582 --> 00:06:12,295
A lot of it had to do with our
personal situations, family things and

97
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:18,416
maybe ideals and promises broken.

98
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,510
It boiled down to alienation
and recognising

99
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,843
we'd look at the mainstream culture

100
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:30,267
and see that it didn't
have a lot to offer us.

101
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:37,448
The real lives and emotions
of America's alienated youth

102
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:40,487
weren't reflected
in the studio polished rock

103
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:44,306
that filled mainstream radio
and MTV.

104
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,036
# But what I need to make me tight are

105
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,379
# Girls, Girls, Girls

106
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:55,518
# Long legs and burgundy lips

107
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:59,723
I was not getting what I needed
from Ted Nugent.

108
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,535
I was a young guy going
to a school I hated,

109
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,844
like a lot of young men,
you hate the school, the teachers,

110
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,141
you want to burn the place
to the ground,

111
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:14,270
and you want something or
someone to represent that for you.

112
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:17,465
Van Halen sang about girls...
Fine!

113
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:23,677
But there wasn't the "white riot,
I wanna riot" thing happening.

114
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:27,110
And there was no sense
of dislocation in that music,

115
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:29,934
where I... I'm out.
I hate all of y'all.

116
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:34,243
Henry Rollins' search for an alternative
would lead him to join a band

117
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:37,313
whose fearsome reputation
would thrill and inspire

118
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:39,620
Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic,

119
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,794
Black Flag.

120
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,986
<i>I got a six-pack,
and nothing to do.</i>

121
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,159
I actually went to see Black Flag play
in Walla Walla, Washington, in 1984.

122
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:02,127
And they had this idea that
they were gonna tour the hinterlands

123
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:04,878
and bring the message to the people.

124
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:06,639
And it was amazing.

125
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:09,144
# Thirty-five dollars
and a six pack to my name

126
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,917
# Six-pack!

127
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,452
# Spent the rest on beer
so who's to blame

128
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,633
# Six-pack!

129
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:19,222
Black Flag played an adrenaline charged
brand of punk known as 'hard core',

130
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,281
a sound that captured the frustration
and rage experienced by many

131
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:25,237
growing up in Reagan's America.

132
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:30,325
# I got a six pack in me alright!

133
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,067
It was this post-punk,
letting out that angst,

134
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:38,573
and just that very honest
fury of youth

135
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:45,318
and all that confusion and pain
into this very short bursts of music.

136
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,683
# Now I got a six so I'll never run out

137
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:49,899
# Six pack!

138
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,859
Some people are gonna listen to
Black Flag and they're gonna love it,

139
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:57,124
and some people...
it's gonna scare them.

140
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,257
Black Flag earned the reputation
of staging shows

141
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,919
which frequently descended
into violence.

142
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,074
# Six pack!

143
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,145
<i>What do they know
about partying?</i>

144
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:10,773
<i>Or anything else?</i>

145
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,802
He runs this place.

146
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:20,164
You'd set up to play in some town
and then here comes the mayor,

147
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:24,497
and a news team, and a reverend.

148
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:27,565
And here comes the Christians
protesting and lighting candles,

149
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:30,453
going like, "Oh my God! No!
Help our children!"

150
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:32,889
# I don't care what's inside

151
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,069
# We're not gonna kill you!

152
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,819
We're like four starving
vegetarians in a van,

153
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:43,144
so they're ready for
this fire-breathing beast,

154
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:45,923
and we're like, "Hi, we're Black Flag.
We hate everyone"

155
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:48,512
<i>It's all right ma'm.
They've gone.</i>

156
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:53,756
# Gimme, gimme, gimme

157
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:55,702
# I need some more

158
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:58,170
Finding somewhere to play
was a challenge for the bands

159
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,014
on the growing alternative scene.

160
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,798
Unable to fill cavernous
arenas and ballrooms,

161
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,508
they had to create their
own improvised circuit.

162
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:10,112
What Black Flag had to do
was basically

163
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:13,081
blaze their own trail,
and they cobbled together

164
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:17,155
this kind of underground
railroad of indie rock.

165
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:21,782
All across America, a whole generation
of alternative rock bands

166
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:23,597
from Black Flag to R.E.M

167
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:28,248
came of age in venues as eclectic
as the bands themselves.

168
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:33,518
There was a small circuit of
clubs, pizza parlors and gay bars

169
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:37,287
and tiny places around the country
that would open their doors

170
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,320
and have really shitty sound systems
and let these bands play.

171
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:46,310
There were times when Black Flag would
play on a Friday and R.E.M. on a Saturday

172
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,356
and the next week we'd play the Friday
and they'd play the Saturday.

173
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:50,587
We were chasing each other for years.

174
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:52,827
And pretty soon there was a circuit.

175
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,938
And when there's a circuit
there's a scene.

176
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:56,946
And when there's a scene
there's a community.

177
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:01,285
And when there's a community then
you've got something really interesting.

178
00:11:01,597 --> 00:11:04,568
That community united
a wide variety of bands

179
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:07,947
who shared the same independent spirit
and circumstances,

180
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,872
and a fierce determination
to make it on their own terms.

181
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:21,123
Touring bands in a van get by.
And what do you get in return?

182
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,559
300 hundred sweaty,
adoring fans a night,

183
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:26,309
and your freedom,
your musical freedom.

184
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:28,108
And maybe you missed some meals

185
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:31,141
or the cops came and
shut your show down,

186
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:37,970
but man, you weren't flipping burgers,
and you weren't filling slurpies.

187
00:11:38,176 --> 00:11:40,362
And there was something
to be said for that.

188
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:45,584
Life on the road was an essential rite of
passage for all alternative rock bands.

189
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:49,329
But for R.E.M,
a band that had formed in 1980,

190
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:52,212
in the tiny university
town of Athens, Georgia,

191
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:56,250
it would also prove to be a springboard
to far greater success.

192
00:11:56,358 --> 00:12:01,406
And it began with a song inspired
by a cold war radio station,

193
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:04,067
<i>Radio Free Europe
calls on Presov.</i>

194
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,664
# Calling all in transit,
calling all in transit

195
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:09,566
# Calling all in transit,
calling all in transit

196
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:14,069
# Radio free Europe, radio...

197
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:19,003
'Radio Free Europe' instantly laid out
the R.E.M. blueprint.

198
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,251
Peter Buck chiming guitar chords,

199
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,731
Mike Mills and Bill Berry's
energetic rhythm section,

200
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:31,270
but it would be Michael Stipe's
enigmatic vocals and performances

201
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:33,556
that became the band's
early trademark.

202
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:37,011
# That this isn't country at all

203
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,675
I was just an incredibly shy person
and not terribly confident.

204
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:46,117
I had terrible acne and used my hair
to cover my face a lot.

205
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,268
I mumbled when I talked
and mumbled when I sang.

206
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:54,832
So all that combined into what I guess
came across as some modicum of charisma.

207
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:57,047
And people were very
taken by it.

208
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,460
# Calling all in transit,
calling all in transit

209
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:02,324
# Calling all in transit,
calling all in transit

210
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:07,123
# Radio free Europe, radio...

211
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:12,357
Michael Stipe's mystique helped make
'Radio Free Europe' a critical hit,

212
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,978
as the new breed of bands began
to receive airplay

213
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,209
on another alternative network,

214
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,793
'Call It Radio'.

215
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:25,758
# Read about your band
in some local page

216
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:31,200
# Didn't mention your name,
didn't mention your name

217
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:39,859
It was that separate world of what
is now called alternative rock,

218
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:42,452
which at the time was only
called college rock

219
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:46,984
because the only place you heard it
on the radio was on college stations,

220
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:49,356
it's the classic Replacements' song
'Left of the Dial'.

221
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:51,872
# ...in a long, long while

222
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,405
# I'll try to find you

223
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:58,671
# Left of the dial

224
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:01,570
# Left of the dial

225
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:06,128
It's a song about where
you tuned manually,

226
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:09,099
you turned the little knob
to the left of the dial,

227
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,696
to the 88.9s and the 90.1s,

228
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:13,810
all the stuff that was below
the commercial band.

229
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:18,345
You had to look for it,

230
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:22,335
and people who really wanted
something more out of music,

231
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,989
who wanted more out of life,
something more out of their guitars,

232
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:28,170
that's where you went.

233
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:35,368
As more and more people
turned to the left of the dial

234
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:38,970
they discovered that even fast
and furious alternative rock bands,

235
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:43,814
such as Hüsker Dü were, like R.E.M.,
embracing melody and harmony.

236
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:47,784
# Going out each day to score

237
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,215
# She was no whore but for me

238
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:53,048
# Celebrating every day

239
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:55,549
# The way she thought it should be

240
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:58,243
# And I don't know what to do

241
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:03,385
When Hüsker Dü started
introducing melody

242
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,494
that introduced a whole
new audience of people.

243
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:09,386
It wasn't kind of the thuggish,
thick-necked guys

244
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:12,185
who just wanted to go to a show
and bash into each other.

245
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:17,093
You started to get people
with glasses and girls.

246
00:15:17,523 --> 00:15:19,528
# For what she believed

247
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:22,215
# And I don't know what to do

248
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:24,221
# Now that pink has turned to blue

249
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:30,086
Major labels homed in on Hüsker Dü
and bands like The Replacements,

250
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,487
but R.E.M. were the anointed ones
of college radio,

251
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:36,975
and in 1987 they began work
on the album

252
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,088
that would launch them
into the mainstream,

253
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:40,954
'Document'.

254
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,816
We never intended to have
a commercial sound

255
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:48,604
because to us that was anathema.
Commercial sound equals death.

256
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:50,804
But we decided to make some records

257
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,647
that were more like what
we sounded like live.

258
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:55,649
And that's a very heavy guitar
dominated sound.

259
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:58,462
The band recruited Scot Litt,

260
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:02,580
the producer who had previously worked
with pop group Katrina and the Waves,

261
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:04,869
to help them craft a more
dynamic sound

262
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,431
that would yield
their first top ten hit.

263
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:16,051
# This one goes out
to the one I love

264
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:24,696
# This one goes out
to the one I've left behind

265
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:30,681
# A simple prop to occupy my time

266
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:34,911
'The One I Love' was a dark love song
based around the arpegio guitar sound

267
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,393
Peter Buck created by plucking
rather than strumming the stings.

268
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,661
Peter Buck has the best right hand
in the business.

269
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:46,564
It is the essence of the R.E.M. sound,
certainly musically speaking,

270
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:52,009
because he decided
to *** the thrashing,

271
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,615
the full chord whatever thing
that everybody else was doing,

272
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:55,870
'cause that's the easy part.

273
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:58,478
The hard thing is working
with your right hand.

274
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:11,050
Michael Stipe delivered his most
clear and direct vocal yet,

275
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,791
even though the lyrics offered up

276
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:16,630
a dark and tangled tale
of manipulation and deceit.

277
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:19,639
# Fire!

278
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:23,914
'The one I love' is a song that
I didn't want to put on the record.

279
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,354
I thought it was too mean,
and too brutal and...

280
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,000
It was just a mean song.

281
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:32,270
As it turned out, I think
in recording, Scott and the band

282
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,289
recognised that
this might actually be

283
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,388
a song that could
get played on the radio.

284
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:38,040
So we turned the voice up a little.

285
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,378
It's a great song,
but the thing is, it's a sneaky one.

286
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,788
It's a dagger in the back.
It's not a love song, obviously,

287
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,940
for anyone who really
takes time to listen to it.

288
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,335
The song was punctuated
by dramatic cries of anguish.

289
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,144
# Fire!

290
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,886
Producer Scott Litt
emphasized the drama of the vocal

291
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:02,891
by adding a harmony from
drummer Bill Berry.

292
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:11,083
See? That kind of thing.
That's Bill doubled there.

293
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,524
Two of his voices
on one track.

294
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,391
That's how we would
thicken things up.

295
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,954
And then the great ending.

296
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:43,858
R.E.M.'s success showed
that alternative rock

297
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,506
was becoming a big business.

298
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:47,098
And it would change the lives

299
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:50,308
of the bands that had eked out
a humble living on the road

300
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:52,044
just a few years before.

301
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,707
I remember sitting with Michael Stipe
in his home in Athens, Georgia,

302
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:59,476
in his kitchen. He puts the phone down.

303
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:02,858
And he said, "What does
a gold record mean?"

304
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,932
And we had to call the office back
and go, "What does that mean?"

305
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:09,183
He goes, "It's half a million!"

306
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:14,102
"You sold half a million records?"
And I was there with Stipe

307
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:16,339
when that came over the wire.

308
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:19,637
And it was so cool that
neither of us knew.

309
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:23,613
And that was probably
the last time he didn't know, forever.

310
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:27,223
In Aberdeen,

311
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:31,485
gold records were distant dreams
for Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic,

312
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:36,464
but by 1988 they had
the makings of a band,

313
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,223
with Kurt on guitar and vocals,

314
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:42,559
Krist on base and
Chad Channing on drums.

315
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:46,556
<i>Here we have your typical
American hard rock band</i>

316
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:50,004
<i>sitting up for a day's practice.</i>

317
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:00,045
<i>This goes into your guitar.</i>

318
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,567
I found in Cobain's journals
at one point

319
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:05,592
a list of names he was considering,
and they included things like

320
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:12,584
Poo Poo Box, Spina Bifida,
Whisker Biscuit and a few others.

321
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:16,644
You just have to go back and say,
if this band had been named Poo Poo Box,

322
00:20:16,722 --> 00:20:19,105
can you imagine them
overtaking the world

323
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:21,309
and selling 10 million
copies of their record?

324
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,554
Kurt finally settled on Nirvana.

325
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:27,152
But for an aspiring band
in Washington State

326
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,755
there was only one place to go,
Seattle.

327
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:34,327
The band drove up in a truck
that someone had borrowed

328
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:36,382
and I remember Novoselic telling me

329
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:38,721
there was actually a functioning
woodstove in the back.

330
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,304
It's like the 'Beverly Hillbillies',

331
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:43,667
essentially it's what they
looked like coming into Seattle.

332
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:55,922
Seattle's vibrant music scene

333
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:59,226
had spawned bands like Soundgarden
and Alice in Chains

334
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,878
with a dark, intense sound
inspired by 70s heavy metal,

335
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:07,434
and with lyrics full of alienation
and self-loathing... grunge.

336
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:10,752
And it had been unleashed
on the wider world by the band Mudhoney

337
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,693
with the song 'Touch me, I'm sick'.

338
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:20,805
# I'm a creep, yeah, I'm a jerk

339
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:24,060
# Come on

340
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:27,174
# Touch me, I'm sick

341
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:32,927
For the most part I just
stood back and let them go at it.

342
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,820
I enjoyed what they were doing.

343
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:37,530
I thought, "This is really noisy.

344
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,848
"Are you sure you want it
to be this noisy, guys?

345
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:43,877
"You really want the guitars
to sound this dirty? Mmm, Ok."

346
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,593
# ...girl - everything I got

347
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:55,024
'Grunge' means this kind of music
that's dripping with bits of garage rock,

348
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:02,440
and punk and metal and
it's just like hard, outrageous and

349
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:08,808
at the same time, just kind of like
living underneath a rock, in a way.

350
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,133
# If you don't come

351
00:22:11,157 --> 00:22:13,530
# You'll die alone

352
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:17,566
Nirvana channeled the grunge sound
on their debut album, 'Bleach',

353
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:22,614
recorded for just 600$ on indie label
'Sub Pop', by Jack Endino.

354
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,916
But included one song the hinted
at Nirvana's crossover potential,

355
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,278
despite Kurt's reservations.

356
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:32,715
When it came the time to record
'About a girl',

357
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:35,146
which is the pop song in the record,

358
00:22:35,191 --> 00:22:38,071
Kurt felt like he had
to sort of make an excuse for it.

359
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:40,046
He was a little uneasy about it.

360
00:22:40,163 --> 00:22:42,845
He said, "Bear with me here, Jack.

361
00:22:42,846 --> 00:22:46,473
"I've got this song,
it's kind of a pop song.

362
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:48,762
"I hope the Sub Pop guys like it

363
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,483
"and that they don't think
it's too commercial or something."

364
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:54,236
# I'm standing in your line

365
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:57,939
# I do, Hope you have the time

366
00:22:57,978 --> 00:23:01,533
# I do, Pick a number too

367
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:05,395
# I do, Keep a date with you

368
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,930
# I'll take advantage while

369
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:12,587
# You hang me out to dry

370
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:17,758
# But I can't see you every night free

371
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:19,910
Kurt Cobain's concerns about the song

372
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:22,465
went to the heart
of the alternative rock dilemma,

373
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,355
the more popular it became

374
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,693
the more it risked loosing
its independence and integrity.

375
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:31,740
R.E.M. though, showed that
there might be a way forward.

376
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,799
They'd grown on their own terms

377
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:36,367
and Michael Stipe relished
the bigger stage,

378
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,997
but it came with a burden
of responsibility.

379
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,539
Yeah, I had become the voice
of a generation,

380
00:23:48,603 --> 00:23:50,706
of political activism through
the Reagan years,

381
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:54,036
and I was suddenly expected
to have all the answers,

382
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:59,679
and to have encyclopedic, academic
knowledge on say, the greenhouse effect.

383
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:04,289
And I didn't realise what I had done,
what I was doing was speaking out

384
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,177
about things I was concerned
about as a person.

385
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:07,915
# I believe in watching you

386
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:10,370
# I believe in what you do

387
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:12,854
# I believe in watching you

388
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,870
# I believe in what you do

389
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,771
# I believe in watching you

390
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:29,326
# I could turn you inside-out

391
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:36,270
R.E.M.'s 1989 'Green' Tour
had been exhilarating but exhausting.

392
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:38,325
After a decade on the road,

393
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,763
they'd earned the creative
freedom to do whatever they wanted.

394
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:46,434
Even if that meant laying down
their guitars.

395
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:53,391
We had been on tour from April 5th
of 1980, the first show that we ever did,

396
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:56,372
until the end of 1989.
We had not stopped touring

397
00:24:56,431 --> 00:25:00,383
or recording and at the end
of the Green World Tour,

398
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,677
I think Bill Berry is the one
who said, I can't do this,

399
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:07,158
we need to take a break,
and so we took a long break.

400
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:11,816
Peter was, I think, afraid
of becoming a rock icon

401
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:14,721
so he put down the electric guitar,
he was sick of it,

402
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,124
and picked up a mandolin.

403
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:26,838
R.E.M.'s new sound would be
perfectly crystallised in a song

404
00:25:26,882 --> 00:25:29,617
that was to become
their defining chart hit.

405
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:35,558
# Oh, life is bigger

406
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,961
# It's bigger than you

407
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:41,569
# And you are not me

408
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:44,280
# The lengths that I will go to

409
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,326
The success of 'Losing my religion'
owed much to a striking video

410
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:51,291
that put Michael Stipe
firmly in the spotlight.

411
00:25:52,305 --> 00:25:56,685
# Oh no, I've said too much

412
00:25:57,505 --> 00:26:00,475
# I haven't said enough

413
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:04,228
# I thought that I heard you laughing

414
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:07,132
Peter Buck plucked
the strings of the mandolin

415
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:09,196
in the R.E.M. arpegio style,

416
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:13,295
but he couldn't resist adding
a subtle chime of electric guitar.

417
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:18,916
That's a guitar called a 'Robin',
Peter used to call it his 'Robin'.

418
00:26:19,002 --> 00:26:23,630
It's an electric guitar but
it's in the octave of the mandolin.

419
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:30,113
There's the mandolin.

420
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:35,784
And this doubling guitar
doesn't need to strum along really,

421
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:41,822
so we just...
just having downbeats arpegiated.

422
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:49,419
Scott Litt enhanced the lushness
of the sound with a string section.

423
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,557
Violins, violas...

424
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:02,511
Again the movement in the track.

425
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:08,833
# I think I thought I saw you try

426
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:13,905
# That was just a dream

427
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:18,164
# Try, cry, why try?

428
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:21,384
The video cemented R.E.M.
as MTV favourites,

429
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:25,672
even though the band hadn't been
convinced that the song would be a hit.

430
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:30,647
Why would anyone be surprised?

431
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:34,069
Its a 5'30'' song with a mandolin
as the lead instrument.

432
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:36,231
There's no chorus.
Why wouldn't that be a hit?

433
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:38,515
That should be a hit everywhere.

434
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:48,702
There's R.E.M. before and after
'Loosing my religion',

435
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:52,046
it was a huge, huge
international hit.

436
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:57,800
And I went from being a fairly
well known but fringe pop star

437
00:27:57,888 --> 00:28:00,814
to being a full blown celebrity.

438
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,007
We'd like to especially
thank 'College Radio'

439
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:06,115
for supporting us all these years
and putting us here tonight.

440
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:07,815
And we'd like to thank the fans

441
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:11,004
from twelve years back
all the way to yesterday.

442
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,179
Everybody, thank you so much.

443
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:17,004
That took some getting used to.

444
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:18,877
But I actually enjoyed it.

445
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:22,976
'That's me in the spotlight' pretty much
shined the spotlight right on me.

446
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:28,220
R.E.M.'s success showed Kurt Cobain
it was possible to court a big audience

447
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:31,873
without sacrificing passion
and authenticity.

448
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:38,985
I've always thought about R.E.M
as a commercial band in the first place.

449
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,661
They just happen to be a good,
passionate commercial band.

450
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:46,579
And there've always been
good, passionate bands in rock 'n roll

451
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:47,769
throughout the history.

452
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,941
It's just up to fans and people
involved in the music industry

453
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:56,188
to make sure that it doesn't get
as stale and as bad

454
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,666
as it has within the last 10 years.

455
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:01,677
Especially in the Reagan era.

456
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:05,844
Kurt Cobain was searching for a sound

457
00:29:05,897 --> 00:29:08,190
that could be both
commercial and passionate,

458
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,230
and in the spring of 1991, with
new drummer Dave Grohl in the band,

459
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:14,688
Nirvana hit on a musical dynamic

460
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:18,572
that would send a buzz of excitement
through their rehearsals.

461
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:23,302
What we would do is we would go in
to this rehearsal space to write songs,

462
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:27,284
and the first half an hour of every
practice we would just freeformed jam,

463
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,588
just go for it.

464
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:33,651
Sometimes it was total noise,
and sometimes there was a song there.

465
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,303
But so what we would do is
we would see how quiet we could get

466
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,118
and to see how loud we could go.

467
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:44,765
There's that whole dynamic
of loud-quiet, loud-quiet.

468
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:50,275
Maybe that's what you get when you
combine heavy riff rock with pop music,

469
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:53,010
and then you have a song that
actually has a big hook chorus

470
00:29:53,071 --> 00:30:00,361
and you have a heavy loud rock band
that just really pushes it forward.

471
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:02,045
# Taken time is

472
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,801
# All but true

473
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,692
# You're the reason

474
00:30:05,742 --> 00:30:07,413
# I feel pain

475
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:09,305
# Feels so good to

476
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:11,404
# Feel again

477
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:21,362
It was a sound that Kurt Cobain
had always dreamed of,

478
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:24,979
noise and melody, hard guitars
and harmonies,

479
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:30,265
and it first discovered it in the music
of alternative rock's unsung heroes.

480
00:30:31,457 --> 00:30:34,842
Kurt had always talked about
what would happen if you

481
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:38,695
started a band that melted
Black Sabbath and The Beatles.

482
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:43,453
So, all along he was just thinking
about aggression and tunefulness.

483
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,203
And that was The Pixies.

484
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:48,972
# Gouge away

485
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,711
# You can gouge away

486
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,377
# Stay all day

487
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:59,912
The Pixies had formed in Boston in
1985 and begun crafting a minimal sound

488
00:30:59,952 --> 00:31:03,996
based around the simple dynamic
of quiet-loud.

489
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:08,277
Quiet in the verse,
loud in the chorus.

490
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,422
Or the other way around.
'Gouge Away' the chorus is....

491
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:14,438
# Gouge away

492
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:17,717
# You can gouge away

493
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:19,658
# Stay all day

494
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:22,355
# If you want to

495
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,554
And then...
the verse is...

496
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,070
# ... aggravation

497
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:31,226
# Some sacred questions

498
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:32,892
# You stroke my locks

499
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:36,891
The verse is up and then...

500
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:39,127
# Gouge away

501
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:42,964
# You can gouge away

502
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:47,890
What The Pixies did
was take soft and loud

503
00:31:47,954 --> 00:31:50,571
and do all sort of interesting
things in that,

504
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:55,543
so their guitars kind of veer off.
They're not just going in a straight line.

505
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:08,806
The Pixies unique sound

506
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:12,443
owed much the band's
raw, untrained musical imagination,

507
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:18,104
and bassist Kim Deal's desire
to avoid the usual rock clichés.

508
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:22,993
A lot of it is our limitations,
like when the end of the song's coming,

509
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:25,101
I don't know we've ever gone.

510
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,075
I don't think that...
Honestly...

511
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:33,818
This is one of five maybe- on the hand,

512
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:37,165
that I have done this
in my life, right there.

513
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,668
I think I did pretty good.

514
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:41,506
It felt good.

515
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:44,251
The Pixies minimal approach

516
00:32:44,316 --> 00:32:47,691
was summed up on a classic
song of surreal confusion.

517
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:50,476
# With your feet in the air...

518
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,678
'Where is my mind'

519
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:59,516
# Try this trick and spin it, yeah

520
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,224
# Your head will collapse

521
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:04,165
# But there's nothing in it

522
00:33:04,204 --> 00:33:05,861
# And you'll ask yourself

523
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,305
# Where is my mind

524
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:11,125
# Where is my mind

525
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:14,854
# Where is my mind

526
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:18,142
Kim Deal helped propel the song
with a simple base line

527
00:33:18,202 --> 00:33:20,962
resisting the urge to overelaborate.

528
00:33:31,191 --> 00:33:34,904
But you can't believe how
some people cannot do that,

529
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:36,268
and will not do that.

530
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:38,528
Especially real base players.

531
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:40,757
I'm looking at you.

532
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:44,860
What they'll do
is sort of go...

533
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,369
Because there's this little
drum thing that happens,

534
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:48,893
or maybe it's a guitar thing.

535
00:33:57,712 --> 00:34:00,722
And they want to help push
every little moment,

536
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:02,343
they want to be involved.

537
00:34:04,952 --> 00:34:07,874
They won't just
pedal through something.

538
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:13,356
The Pixies provided the final ingredient
Kurt Cobain had been looking for.

539
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,806
Nirvana had arrived at a sound
that blended the fury of grunge

540
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:22,547
with a new feel for melody
and the mass commercial appeal of R.E.M.

541
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:24,625
And in April, 1991,

542
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,659
Nirvana performed a raw
version of a new song

543
00:34:27,694 --> 00:34:29,989
that would draw
all those elements together

544
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:33,537
to become alternative rock's
defining anthem.

545
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,924
<i>This song is called
'Smells like teen spirit'.</i>

546
00:34:49,781 --> 00:34:52,791
The band built up the drama
and tension in the song

547
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:56,140
by using the Pixies'
quiet-loud trademark.

548
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:01,217
What happened was that
we played that riff over and over again,

549
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:06,270
and then Dave or I would stop.

550
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:13,272
"Just slow this down.
Like the moment you slow this down

551
00:35:13,316 --> 00:35:19,175
you have a kind of a dynamic."
And once we did that, it made sense.

552
00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:21,280
# Come out and play

553
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:23,125
# Make up the rules

554
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:25,007
# I know I hope

555
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:26,510
# To die the truth

556
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,045
'Smells like teen spirit' I really
remember thinking,

557
00:35:29,245 --> 00:35:34,165
that is such a Pixies rip.
It is, the baseline,

558
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:40,466
and the chord-key single note
guitar thing over the drums.

559
00:35:41,995 --> 00:35:47,639
I mean it was almost thrown away
at one point just because

560
00:35:48,332 --> 00:35:50,281
just seemed too much
like the Pixies.

561
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:52,273
# A dirty word

562
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:56,442
With 'Smells like teen spirit'
Nirvana had the basis for a hit.

563
00:35:56,574 --> 00:36:00,179
But they needed a producer who
could harness their live energy

564
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:03,452
and shape it into a more
radio-friendly sound.

565
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:07,473
Actually, truth be told,

566
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:11,879
I was one of the people that was
on the short list to produce 'Nevermind',

567
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,629
and I passed.

568
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:17,605
Do you want to stop now?

569
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:19,650
# ...and contagious

570
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,670
# Here we are now

571
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,629
# Entertain us

572
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:25,680
# A mulatto

573
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:26,443
# An albino

574
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:30,093
The band finally settled on a producer
with underground credentials

575
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:32,883
and a pop touch,
Butch Vig.

576
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:36,772
I knew I just wanted to set them up
in a big room and try to capture

577
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:40,833
the energy in the initial performance.

578
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:43,888
Make sure that was the most
important thing about the song.

579
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:48,074
But I also wanted to make it sound
bigger and much more focused

580
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:49,947
than 'Bleach' was.

581
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:53,474
In order to achieve a richer sound
on the 'Nevermind' album,

582
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:57,004
Butch Vig created multiple layers
of Kurt's voice.

583
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:01,890
A process known as doubletracking
that the singer initially resisted.

584
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,101
He really didn't like
doing things over again,

585
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:09,572
but he loved The Beatles so I knew
I could use an excuse if I had,

586
00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:13,512
and that was that John Lennon
always doubletracked his vocals.

587
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:17,909
He hated the sound of his voice
and because Kurt was such a Beatles fan,

588
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:20,050
every time I used the John Lennon
reference he'd go, "Ok."

589
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:23,599
# With the lights out
its less dangerous

590
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:25,897
# Here we are now

591
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:27,769
# Entertain us

592
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:31,768
# I feel stupid and contagious

593
00:37:31,822 --> 00:37:33,822
# Here we are now

594
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,846
# Entertain us

595
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:40,160
'Teen Spirit' was plain
to see in the song's video,

596
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:43,552
but its title had less
rebellious origins.

597
00:37:45,038 --> 00:37:47,543
<i>The physical sensation.
Teen Spirit.</i>

598
00:37:47,592 --> 00:37:50,035
<i>The only anti-perspirant made
for our generation.</i>

599
00:37:50,074 --> 00:37:50,942
<i>Teen Spirit.</i>

600
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:52,070
<i>With five fragrances.</i>

601
00:37:52,123 --> 00:37:55,653
Kurt's former girlfriend used
a deodorant called 'Teen Spirit',

602
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:58,718
prompting a mutual friend
called Kathleen Hanna

603
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:01,345
to create a historic
piece of graffiti.

604
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:06,734
So one night we went out and got all
fucked up, me and Kurt and Kathleen Hanna.

605
00:38:06,783 --> 00:38:09,965
And Kathleen had some
spray paint and

606
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:14,541
in Kurt's bedroom she sprayed,
"Kurt smells like Teen Spirit'.

607
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:17,173
So it's kind of like saying,
Kurt has coodies,

608
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:19,689
or Kurt smells like this girl.

609
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:23,650
But Kurt didn't know that it was
the name of a deodorant

610
00:38:23,674 --> 00:38:27,611
and he just simply saw it and said,
"Oh. Teen Spirit. That's a great line."

611
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:31,507
And it wasn't until the song actually
came out that somebody said,

612
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:34,155
"It's strange your wrote a song
about a woman's deodorant."

613
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:35,635
And he said, "I did?"

614
00:38:35,674 --> 00:38:37,194
# A mulatto

615
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:39,311
# An albino

616
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:41,928
Cobain had a surprise
of his own in store

617
00:38:42,005 --> 00:38:43,780
for the end
of the 'Teen Spirit' video.

618
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:48,690
A shot of a janitor that harked back
to his first job in Aberdeen.

619
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:56,044
Kurt would continually dwell
on his troubled youth in his music.

620
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:59,602
And he revisited the darkest hours
he'd spent sleeping rough

621
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:02,834
in the haunting song
'Something in the way'.

622
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:07,656
We did 4, 5 takes of the song
and it just didn't happen.

623
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,146
And out of frustration Kurt
walked in the control room

624
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,480
and laid down on the couch,

625
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:15,144
and started sort of singing the song
and kept playing quieter and quieter,

626
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:17,518
to the point it was almost a whisper.

627
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:21,499
# Underneath the bridge

628
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,025
# The tarp has sprung a leak

629
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:27,487
And I just said,
stop right here,

630
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,703
and I unplugged the phone,
I turned off the air conditioning,

631
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:32,062
I sealed the doors and said,
everybody stay out of here.

632
00:39:32,092 --> 00:39:33,293
And I brought a couple
of mikes in,

633
00:39:33,313 --> 00:39:35,343
and just recorded him
on the couch.

634
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:40,405
# And I'm living off of grass

635
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:46,219
# And the drippings from my ceiling

636
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:49,900
# It's okay to eat fish

637
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:55,868
# 'Cause they don't have any feelings

638
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:59,746
He did live in abandoned houses.
He lived in hallways.

639
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:02,463
He would go sneak into
the hospital he was born in

640
00:40:02,517 --> 00:40:04,187
and sleep in the waiting room,

641
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:07,611
because no one would come and say,
why are you here,

642
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,494
they thought he was waiting
for someone.

643
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:17,114
# Something in the way

644
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:26,042
And, I swear to God,
when he sang it the first time,

645
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:28,405
the song is maybe three minutes long,

646
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:31,277
I swear to God I held
my breath the whole time.

647
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:34,876
# Something in the way

648
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:40,807
Kurt Cobain gave a voice
to an audience

649
00:40:40,864 --> 00:40:43,629
who saw the pain and confusion
of their own lives

650
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:45,286
reflected in his music.

651
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:53,048
There was a passion and quality
in the recording that sounded

652
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:57,618
exciting and dangerous
and something they hadn't heard before.

653
00:40:57,677 --> 00:41:00,825
There was an audience out there
that I think had been set up for that,

654
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,736
by bands like R.E.M. or Hüsker Dü
or The Replacements.

655
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:06,951
And all of a sudden,
to have this record

656
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,691
that sort of encapsulated all those bands
and so many things at the same time,

657
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,364
it had this sheer energy
and this intense impact,

658
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:18,924
people went crazy for it.

659
00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:29,168
In January, 1992,
'Nevermind' finally topped the US charts.

660
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:31,328
The outsiders had won.

661
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:33,493
Grunge fever began in earnest

662
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:37,683
as bands like Pearl Jam and
Smashing Pumpkins joined the party.

663
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:46,954
The mainstream media scented
a youth cult right for exploitation.

664
00:41:49,303 --> 00:41:51,678
Being fashionable used to mean
looking good.

665
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:54,930
Well, thanks to a fad that
started in the Pacific Northwest,

666
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,319
high fashion now means...
Well, you decide.

667
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:04,337
<i>Grunge is the fashion trend launched
by the hard driving guitar music</i>

668
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,288
<i>known as the Seattle sound.</i>

669
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,817
<i>The grunge look is an urban-lumberjack-
anything-goes ensemble</i>

670
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:14,594
<i>of duck boots, tattered shirts,
and long underwear.</i>

671
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:18,886
<i>And the grunge is spreading
to the trendy Hollywood health spots.</i>

672
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:21,532
<i>Even the New York fashion shows.</i>

673
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:25,881
<i>This is the spring look
for 1993.</i>

674
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:36,649
It basically created
a huge spasm of greed.

675
00:42:38,406 --> 00:42:42,076
Labels wanted desperately to sign
another band like Nirvana.

676
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:43,700
Where there's one
there must be more.

677
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:45,543
Let's sign everybody we can.

678
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:48,420
Seattle definitely lost its innocence
in a lot of ways.

679
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,538
Kurt Cobain felt that loss
of innocence personally

680
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:53,700
as he was thrust into the spotlight.

681
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:57,115
Fame and fortune provided
little consolation.

682
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,552
You can't buy happiness, I mean,
that made me happy for a little while,

683
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:07,666
but I was probably just as happy with,
I don't know...

684
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:12,377
I look back on going to second-hand
stores and stuff like that,

685
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:16,408
and finding a little treasure like that,
and that actually meant more to me

686
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:19,570
because it was more
of a stab in the dark.

687
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,288
All of a sudden he's got
that MTV crowd.

688
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:26,593
Like, "Whoooo!
I'm multi-platinum?

689
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:28,931
"Everywhere I go I'm now mobbed?

690
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:32,298
"I still go to the Salvation Army
store to buy my clothes

691
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:33,514
"but I can't go in now

692
00:43:33,547 --> 00:43:38,998
"because they know I go there so
there's like 80 kids waiting in front.

693
00:43:39,098 --> 00:43:40,266
"To see what I'm gonna buy.

694
00:43:40,344 --> 00:43:43,965
"And they've pressed up to the glass so
much they cracked the glass of the store."

695
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:45,970
This was all happening
to that guy.

696
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:49,707
Some people can handle it,
some people can't.

697
00:43:56,788 --> 00:44:01,170
Kurt Cobain wasn't the only one longing
for a simpler, more innocent time.

698
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:06,052
From their hometown of Athens, Georgia,
R.E.M had watched alternative rock

699
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,708
grow from a tiny independent community

700
00:44:08,784 --> 00:44:11,719
into a fully-fledged
commercial enterprise.

701
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:15,057
And they now began to craft
an album that took stock

702
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:17,968
of what had been won and lost
on the way.

703
00:44:21,044 --> 00:44:22,871
My grandparents were
getting very old

704
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:27,247
and I was reflecting a lot
on death, and passage

705
00:44:27,325 --> 00:44:30,114
and sorrow and mourning
and all this stuff.

706
00:44:30,144 --> 00:44:34,376
And that really influenced the material
for 'Automatic for the people'.

707
00:44:34,434 --> 00:44:39,165
It's a pretty sombre record,
but quite beautiful, I think.

708
00:44:39,975 --> 00:44:42,011
And it captured something
very real.

709
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:55,911
'Automatic for the people'
is steeped in memories

710
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,651
and one song based around Mike Mill's
simple piano refrain

711
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,789
harked back to the golden days
of the band's youth.

712
00:45:05,253 --> 00:45:07,789
Honestly I think we were here
in this very studio,

713
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:10,552
and I was playing it and I wasn't
really thinking anything of it.

714
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:13,517
I was just doing it because it was
something I had and I was working on,

715
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:17,239
and Michael heard it and said,
"Keep going, keep going."

716
00:45:17,273 --> 00:45:22,228
And I think he heard something
that took him to a place.

717
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:32,071
It was actually somewhat autobiographic.
It came from a real thing.

718
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:38,395
# I forgot my shirt at the water's edge

719
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:41,254
# The moon is low tonight

720
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,680
A lot of people in Athens had parties
and then at 2 in the morning

721
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:47,812
everyone would go out to a pond
or a lake and jump in the water,

722
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:50,522
get drunk and sleep with each other.

723
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:53,317
That was kind of the inspiration
for the song 'Nightswimming'.

724
00:45:54,499 --> 00:46:00,179
# Nightswimming deserves a quiet night

725
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:07,110
# I'm not sure all these
people understand

726
00:46:07,772 --> 00:46:11,237
# It's not like years ago,

727
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:14,983
# The fear of getting caught,

728
00:46:16,165 --> 00:46:19,361
# Of recklessness and water

729
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,028
'Nightswimming' was infused
with the spirit of Athens, Georgia,

730
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:26,390
but the band decided to put
the finishing touches to the album

731
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:28,856
in the new music capital of Seattle,

732
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,690
where a friendship would blossom
between R.E.M. and Nirvana.

733
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:45,054
Peter had moved to Seattle
and had become friends with

734
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:46,731
this band called Nirvana.

735
00:46:48,878 --> 00:46:51,686
We went out there to make the record,
to finish the record

736
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,190
and ended up hanging out
with those guys a lot.

737
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,542
They were so awesome and cool.

738
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:59,428
They loved R.E.M. and we loved
what they had done.

739
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:01,486
It was a great moment in time.

740
00:47:01,882 --> 00:47:04,043
Michael Stipe would
even become godfather to

741
00:47:04,097 --> 00:47:07,102
Kurt Cobain and his wife
Courtney Love's daughter.

742
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:11,504
Kurt himself told me that the band
he had come to admire most was R.E.M.

743
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:15,352
Because everything they had achieved
they had done it without compromise.

744
00:47:15,608 --> 00:47:19,901
And he had seen everything
that he had been a part of

745
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:23,605
suddenly become part of
this machine that he despised.

746
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:25,988
And there was nothing
he could do about it.

747
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,689
Michael Stipe recognised the kindred
spirit in Kurt Cobain,

748
00:47:30,762 --> 00:47:34,625
but one whose emotional honesty
left him vulnerable.

749
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:39,490
Kurt Cobain had this incredible
sensitivity...

750
00:47:39,554 --> 00:47:42,709
It's kind of what did him in
in the end, really,

751
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:46,258
he was just a very delicate creature,
for a lot of reasons.

752
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:49,621
But he was very real,

753
00:47:49,684 --> 00:47:52,832
and he showed his emotion
very clearly in his work.

754
00:47:52,901 --> 00:47:57,335
And a lot of that emotion was
just incredible rage and anger.

755
00:47:58,189 --> 00:48:01,508
That rage boiled over
in the spring of 1993,

756
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:04,341
as Kurt Cobain grappled
with the responsibilities

757
00:48:04,439 --> 00:48:06,606
of fatherhood and stardom,

758
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:09,729
and the demons of depression
and addiction.

759
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:14,508
With just a trace of grim irony
Kurt joked that Nirvana's next album

760
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:18,276
would be called
'I hate myself, and I want to die'.

761
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:25,311
# 'Cause everybody hurts...

762
00:48:25,826 --> 00:48:31,408
It's as if the moment he reached
that pinnacle stardom

763
00:48:31,496 --> 00:48:34,437
it was too bright
and he had to drop it,

764
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:37,619
and he began retreating
from that moment on.

765
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:43,787
Moving away from stardom,
moving away from all that he had sought,

766
00:48:43,826 --> 00:48:46,944
and moving deeper and deeper
into drugs.

767
00:48:48,454 --> 00:48:51,693
You don't have to be Freud
to analyse

768
00:48:51,738 --> 00:48:54,875
that clearly there was something
about getting what he wanted

769
00:48:54,895 --> 00:48:57,776
that made him still feel unfulfilled.

770
00:48:58,155 --> 00:49:00,370
Eventually released as 'In Utero',

771
00:49:00,424 --> 00:49:03,532
the album featured darkly
tender love songs

772
00:49:03,585 --> 00:49:06,841
and thinly veiled attacks
on the music business.

773
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,639
# Teenage angst has paid off well

774
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:14,942
# Now I'm bored and old

775
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:21,633
'Serve the servants' is a lot about...
I mean, the first opening lines

776
00:49:21,687 --> 00:49:25,182
that say 'Teenage angst has paid off well
now I'm bored and old',

777
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:30,107
that is certainly about my ideas
about grunge rock

778
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:32,844
and what I've experienced
in the last few years.

779
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:37,543
Kurt was still torn between
the underground and the mainstream,

780
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:40,932
rock and pop, rage and melody.

781
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:45,214
'In Utero' may have alienated
some of the fans of 'Nevermind'

782
00:49:45,258 --> 00:49:47,214
but Kurt never lost his gift

783
00:49:47,282 --> 00:49:51,169
for creating music with the potential
to reach a global audience.

784
00:49:51,331 --> 00:49:54,497
That gift was glimpsed
for one last time

785
00:49:54,526 --> 00:49:57,654
during an extraordinary MTV
acoustic concert

786
00:49:57,713 --> 00:50:01,517
later turned into an album
by R.E.M. Scott Litt.

787
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:03,728
'Nirvana Unplugged'.

788
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:23,172
# Come as you are

789
00:50:23,216 --> 00:50:25,363
# As you were

790
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:29,000
# As I want you to be

791
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,559
The rehearsals were a catastrophe.

792
00:50:31,603 --> 00:50:34,583
Everybody there thought
this show is not gonna happen.

793
00:50:34,608 --> 00:50:37,328
Kurt was struggling
with drug withdrawal.

794
00:50:37,627 --> 00:50:39,398
# Take your time

795
00:50:39,992 --> 00:50:43,083
Even the ever reliable Dave Grohl
struggled at first.

796
00:50:44,623 --> 00:50:46,090
It didn't sound good.

797
00:50:46,134 --> 00:50:49,502
Usually I have these massive
fat sticks

798
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:52,013
and I beat the hell out of the drums.

799
00:50:52,023 --> 00:50:56,929
And I got these little cocktail
drum set and we'd

800
00:50:56,979 --> 00:50:59,615
run through a song and
Kurt would turn to me and say,

801
00:51:00,406 --> 00:51:03,081
"Do you think you can
play a little bit softer?"

802
00:51:03,181 --> 00:51:09,074
"Yeah sure. I'll play little bit softer."
And at the end of the song

803
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:13,516
he'd go, "Yeah, just bring it down
a little bit more. A tiny bit."

804
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:16,584
All right, so I'd just barely...

805
00:51:18,149 --> 00:51:21,311
And he'd turn around and say,
"Just a little bit more."

806
00:51:21,322 --> 00:51:24,379
"What the fuck am I doing here?
I won't play if you don't want me to.

807
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:26,356
"I'll shake a rattler or something."

808
00:51:27,908 --> 00:51:33,161
But the MTV producer was on hand
to spare Dave Grohl's blushes.

809
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:43,082
We got to the gig and the producer said,
"Have you ever tried these?"

810
00:51:43,171 --> 00:51:48,329
And he just hands me these sticks
like bundles of chopsticks or something.

811
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:52,391
"Hotrods", yeah, they're made up
of these little wooden dowels

812
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:56,238
and it's got a flappy kind of sound.

813
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,221
Basically the sharpness
is diffused.

814
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:03,906
# Memoria

815
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:08,114
# Memoria

816
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:14,323
I'll never forget after we did
'Unplugged' how happy Kurt was.

817
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:16,641
He was so happy.

818
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:20,121
He was this person right there
on the center.

819
00:52:20,146 --> 00:52:24,512
He was really, really happy after that.
He was relieved and...

820
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:28,578
We pulled it off.

821
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,645
That happiness would be short-lived.

822
00:52:40,729 --> 00:52:44,115
Behind the scenes Kurt
was beginning to unravel,

823
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,943
tormented with depression
and heroin addiction.

824
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:52,036
He attempted suicide in Rome
just four months later.

825
00:52:53,535 --> 00:52:56,729
The last couple of months
of Kurt's life were a train wreck.

826
00:52:56,777 --> 00:52:59,312
People were doing the best
they could to get him help,

827
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:02,081
but it's almost a spiritual
question that gets raised,

828
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:04,572
what can you do for somebody
who, at that point,

829
00:53:04,596 --> 00:53:09,055
is so much wanting
to destruct their own lives?

830
00:53:09,655 --> 00:53:12,546
Members of the music
community tried to offer support.

831
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:17,282
R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, gravely
concerned at unfolding events,

832
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:19,870
made a desperate
attempt to rescue Kurt

833
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:21,566
from his spiraling descent.

834
00:53:22,141 --> 00:53:23,295
We talked about collaborating.

835
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:26,188
It was really in the last
days of his life.

836
00:53:26,207 --> 00:53:32,679
I created a... in an attempt to pull him
out of the headspace he was in in Seattle,

837
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:35,586
in this house, all alone,
the last weeks.

838
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:40,407
I created a project that he had
to fly to Georgia to work with me on

839
00:53:40,421 --> 00:53:42,237
and we had a deadline
and bla, bla, bla...

840
00:53:42,276 --> 00:53:44,333
It was really just an attempt

841
00:53:44,408 --> 00:53:47,072
to pull him out of
the headspace space that he was in

842
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:48,111
and it didn't work.

843
00:53:48,186 --> 00:53:49,456
Sadly.

844
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,471
Despite last edge interventions
by those closest to Kurt Cobain

845
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:58,775
the singer was found dead in
his Seattle home on April the 8th, 1994.

846
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:01,299
He had shot himself
three days earlier.

847
00:54:01,383 --> 00:54:05,962
When Police arrived, they found
a suicide note quoting Neil Young's lyric,

848
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,932
'It's better to burn out
than fade away',

849
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:11,091
and the stereo still turned on.

850
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:13,003
What we do know, when he died,

851
00:54:13,057 --> 00:54:17,494
that R.E.M. was the last CD
in his CD player.

852
00:54:17,543 --> 00:54:21,635
The Police found the CD player on
and they found R.E.M. in it.

853
00:54:21,694 --> 00:54:24,195
Now, whether that was
the last thing he listened to,

854
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:28,017
there's some degree
of speculation about that.

855
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:30,455
We do know, of course,
what he said in the suicide note.

856
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:34,145
And in my years as a journalist
I don't think I've ever felt

857
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:37,551
more haunted than actually looking
at the suicide note

858
00:54:37,586 --> 00:54:40,302
and seeing how hard he had
pressed down with his pen

859
00:54:40,346 --> 00:54:43,886
to make sure that his words
were clearly read.

860
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:50,419
Just three years after alternative rock
had achieved his greatest triumph,

861
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:53,993
it had lost its most iconic,
enigmatic figurehead.

862
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:56,188
To some, it almost seemed

863
00:54:56,223 --> 00:54:59,464
that Kurt Cobain had already
recorded his own epitaph.

864
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:03,262
A haunting version of song
'Where did you sleep last night',

865
00:55:03,321 --> 00:55:05,273
by blues legend Leadbelly,

866
00:55:05,297 --> 00:55:09,336
that captured all the passion,
belief and raw emotion

867
00:55:09,395 --> 00:55:13,928
that alternative rock had so
dramatically reclaimed for its audience.

868
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:26,629
# My girl, my girl, don't lie to me,

869
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:32,106
# Tell me where
did you sleep last night

870
00:55:33,184 --> 00:55:34,650
Well, there were some crazy things

871
00:55:34,727 --> 00:55:37,506
again that are filled with
irony about 'Unplugged'.

872
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:39,125
Kurt wanted lilies.

873
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:43,720
Basically he set the set up.
It looks like a funeral.

874
00:55:46,284 --> 00:55:52,813
# My girl, my girl, where will you go?

875
00:55:52,873 --> 00:55:58,385
# I'm going where the cold wind blows.

876
00:55:59,514 --> 00:56:02,926
# In the pines, in the pines,

877
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,250
# Where the sun don't ever shine.

878
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:11,646
# I would shiver the whole night through

879
00:56:12,856 --> 00:56:19,568
# Her husband, was a hard working man,

880
00:56:21,397 --> 00:56:23,488
He ends the show with
the Leadbelly song

881
00:56:23,562 --> 00:56:28,285
and that song basically strips the music
of Nirvana all back to a blues.

882
00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:30,197
And it becomes a requiem.

883
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:33,034
It's a perfect requiem
for Nirvana.

884
00:56:33,092 --> 00:56:38,216
# But his body never was found.

885
00:56:39,633 --> 00:56:45,741
# My girl, my girl, don't lie to me,

886
00:56:46,128 --> 00:56:47,352
# Tell me where...

887
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:48,490
After Kurt's death,

888
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:52,205
Scott Litt had to revisit the singer's
most harrowing performance

889
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,480
as he put the finishing touches
to the 'Unplugged' recordings.

890
00:56:55,529 --> 00:56:58,098
Getting through that song
was the hardest thing.

891
00:56:58,152 --> 00:57:01,342
And those were with me,
Krist and Dave.

892
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:04,818
And I remember feeling like
there were ghosts in the room.

893
00:57:06,226 --> 00:57:12,498
# My girl, my girl, where will you go?

894
00:57:12,856 --> 00:57:18,197
# I'm going where the cold wind blows.

895
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:21,171
# In the pines,

896
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,159
# the pines,

897
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:24,970
#  sun,

898
00:57:25,023 --> 00:57:26,600
# .shine.

899
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:33,465
# I shiver the whole...

900
00:57:35,611 --> 00:57:40,404
# night through!

901
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:45,953
It had to end right there.

902
00:57:45,982 --> 00:57:47,605
Right with that scream,
right with that song,

903
00:57:47,641 --> 00:57:49,149
right with that howl.

904
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:52,017
For those left behind,

905
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,751
there will always be sadness
for the loss of a unique talent,

906
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:59,202
and regret for what might have been.

907
00:57:59,806 --> 00:58:02,536
If I could change anything
I wish that Kurt was still alive.

908
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,007
That's the only thing.

909
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,910
That's it.

910
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:11,484
I'm sad that he died so young

911
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:14,486
because I think he was just
moving out of a phase of writing

912
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:18,180
into a new phase that I think
might have been extraordinary.

913
00:58:18,627 --> 00:58:20,450
But he didn't make it.

914
00:58:20,818 --> 00:58:23,070
Kurt Cobain was a brilliant artist.

915
00:58:23,381 --> 00:58:25,617
He could have done whatever
he wanted to do,

916
00:58:25,657 --> 00:58:27,818
and been really good at it.

917
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,328
That's it.
