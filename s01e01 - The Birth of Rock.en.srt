1
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:37,418
September 24th, 1966,

2
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:40,894
un unknown figure touches down
in the streets of London

3
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:46,150
with only a Fender Stratocaster
and a few dollars to his name.

4
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:52,860
Within days of his arrival,

5
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:58,010
Jimi Hendrix would turn
the world of music upside down.

6
00:01:02,386 --> 00:01:04,264
Jimi changed the sound of the guitar.

7
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:06,852
I think in many respects he changed

8
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:08,975
the sound of rock far
more than The Beatles.

9
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:12,111
He called himself
a 'voodoo child',

10
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,038
a virtuoso, who in just four
short years,

11
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,701
will take the blues from
the Mississippi delta

12
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:21,125
to the psychedelic limits
of outer space.

13
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,680
He redefined what it meant
to be a guitar player,

14
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:26,464
what it meant to be a musician,

15
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:28,454
I think he redefined what
it meant to be an artist

16
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:33,309
and he redefined the whole period
in which he existed.

17
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,077
All that stuff that was going on
in the 60s

18
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:42,534
is channeled through
Jimi Hendrix's music.

19
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:46,668
You can hear Martin Luther King
being shot in his music,

20
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:51,264
you can hear bombs falling
on Vietnam in his music,

21
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:55,891
you can hear bombs exploding in the heads
of an entire generation on LSD

22
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,872
in the music of Jimi Hendrix.

23
00:02:01,944 --> 00:02:05,076
In the end, he himself
will become a victim

24
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,351
of the dark side of the era.

25
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:10,016
His tragic death bringing
a symbolic end

26
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:13,129
to the tumultuous 60s.

27
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:19,694
This is a journey into
the first Age of Rock

28
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:23,061
seen through the eyes
of his most dazzling icon...

29
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,875
Jimi Hendrix.

30
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,669
When Jimi Hendrix,
a left hander

31
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,619
who played a right handed
guitar upside down,

32
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,763
made his first explosive appearance
in London in 1966,

33
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:57,254
he sent shockwaves through
the aristocracy of British music.

34
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:04,149
# Purple Haze all in my brain,

35
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,966
# lately things don't seem the same,

36
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:12,355
# actin' funny but I don't know why

37
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,757
# 'scuse me while I kiss the sky.

38
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,851
I saw him perform with everybody else.

39
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,841
With Eric Clapton, boy, you name it,
they were there.

40
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:27,364
He came on the stage and
it was just mindblowing.

41
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:32,685
And I think Eric's comment
after Jimi played was,

42
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,665
"Well, I'm off home
to practice."

43
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,880
I was just glad
I wasn't a guitarist.

44
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,426
Like Eric Clapton,
fellow guitarist Jeff Beck,

45
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:52,248
was also blown away by Hendrix's
guitar pyrotechnics.

46
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:04,259
The fact that he was doing things
so upfront and so wild, unchained.

47
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:06,984
That's what I wanted to do
but being British and

48
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:10,006
the victim of the class system
or whatever...

49
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,008
the poxy old schools I used to go to,
I couldn't do what he did.

50
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,506
And I just went away
from there thinking,

51
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:17,560
I'd better think of
something else to do.

52
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,569
He was doing things
that they couldn't do,

53
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:39,203
because he was picking out a baseline
with his thumb,

54
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:42,653
a lead with his little finger and
playing rhythm with the rest of it.

55
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:46,897
It was a kind of three-man group
on one guitar.

56
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:57,018
The roots of rock lie deep
in the blues of the Mississippi delta.

57
00:04:57,207 --> 00:05:01,474
This music cast a powerful spell
on Jimi Hendrix.

58
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:06,319
Growing up in Seattle in the 50s,
he got his first guitar aged 12,

59
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,988
spending his teens learning the licks
of the twelve-bar blues.

60
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:15,989
# Well I wait around the train station

61
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:18,730
# Waitin' for that train

62
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:24,407
The blues has always been there
way before it was ever called the 'blues'.

63
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:30,891
It's a strand of music... it's a note
that resonates throughout the human race.

64
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,081
In order to escape a jail term
for riding in a stolen Cadillac,

65
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:41,826
Hendrix elected to join
the 101st Airborne Division.

66
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:45,085
It was in the Army that Hendrix
began experimenting

67
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:48,691
with the sounds of electric
rhythm & blues.

68
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:03,835
Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf
and BB King were the godfathers of R&B,

69
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,133
and this electrically charged music
would underpin

70
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:10,178
the early career of Jimi Hendrix.

71
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:16,904
Hendrix's time in the military
was troubled and didn't last long.

72
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:22,522
The end came not long after he was
discovered sleeping with his guitar.

73
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:30,193
Discharged from the Army in 1962,
a pennyless Hendrix

74
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:34,408
found work as a guitar for hire
on the black R&B network

75
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:36,708
known as the Chitlin' Circuit.

76
00:06:37,303 --> 00:06:41,150
It was this alternate nether universe
that happened

77
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:43,105
that most white people
would never experience

78
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,292
or never even know it happened.

79
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:48,084
It happened when
all the white people were asleep,

80
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:52,581
then in this little town,
these bands would come out an put on

81
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,915
these incredible shows.

82
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:57,532
Hendrix spent almost 4 years
on that circuit

83
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,904
playing with a variety
of different bands.

84
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,579
All I remember is getting out
of the Army

85
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:03,878
and then trying to get
something together,

86
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,752
and then I was playing in different groups
all around the States and Canada.

87
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:11,327
Playing behind people
most of the time.

88
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:20,543
He toured alongside the likes of Ike
and Tina Turner, BB King, James Brown...

89
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:23,369
If he wasn't actually on stage
with these people

90
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:27,483
he would be in the wings
watching and learning.

91
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:32,578
Hendrix did a stint as a sideman
to Little Richard

92
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:36,435
whose flamboyance was an inspiration
to the young guitarist.

93
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:39,602
Hendrix said, "I want
to do with the guitar

94
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:42,304
what Little Richard
does with his voice."

95
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:49,149
Jimi Hendrix's perseverance to go on...
he didn't mind looking freaky,

96
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:53,800
like I don't mind it, 'cause I was
doing it before he was.

97
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,469
And I know when he saw me
gave him confidence,

98
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:59,707
and great recompense or reward.
My Lord!

99
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:06,901
4,000 miles away in Britain

100
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:10,275
the R&B Hendrix was playing
on the Chitlin' Circuit

101
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,510
was finding a devoted following.

102
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,117
# I love the way you walk

103
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,500
# I love the way you walk

104
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:22,557
White musicians were
interpreting this music

105
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:26,874
in ways that would in turn prove a key
influence on Jimi Hendrix.

106
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,970
# ... I got my eyes on you

107
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:34,921
It was playing blues that thawed out
the emotional permafrost

108
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:39,904
of 1950s post-war English austerity.

109
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:50,005
Because of its emphasis on improvisation,
it unlocked the creativity

110
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:52,962
of the young musicians who
cut their teeth on it.

111
00:08:55,801 --> 00:09:02,057
Everybody starting out just copied
the records they listened to note for note.

112
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:03,871
I was trying to sing like Howlin' Wolf.

113
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:08,880
But from this copying
we learnt the roads.

114
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:11,142
Tell us something about him, Brian.

115
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:15,280
When we first started playing together
because we wanted to play R&B

116
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:18,029
and Howlin' Wolf was one
of our greatest idols.

117
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:20,308
It's a great pleasure to find
him booked in this show tonight.

118
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,231
- It really is a pleasure.
- Thanks for Howlin's records.

119
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:25,297
So I think it's better that we shut up
and we have Howlin' Wolf on stage.

120
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,122
# How many more years

121
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:33,103
# Have I got to let you dog me around

122
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:38,354
# How many more years

123
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,541
# Have I got to let you dog me around

124
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:50,332
We based everything we did
from our knowledge of

125
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:54,311
starting as a blues band.

126
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,239
# If you see my little red rooster

127
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:04,003
# Please drive him home

128
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:06,400
Formed in 1962,

129
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:10,639
The Rolling Stones took their name
from a classic Muddy Waters' song.

130
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,859
# If you see my little red rooster

131
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,654
The early shows, their sort
of embryonic period,

132
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,303
they just played blues covers.

133
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:22,808
They had no real material of their own,
so to speak, early on.

134
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,659
The key of course was
when they began writing.

135
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:29,576
And when they did,
they used these blues influences

136
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:32,051
and filtered it through
their own experience.

137
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:38,483
'Satisfaction' is really one
of the first great Stones' songs.

138
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:40,929
It's a song that Muddy Waters
would have been happy to write.

139
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:43,522
I think it would rank
as a great blues song

140
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,709
even if it had come from one
of those guys on Chess Records.

141
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:53,048
# I can get no satisfaction

142
00:10:53,708 --> 00:11:00,027
# I can't get no girl reaction

143
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:04,612
'Satisfaction' is basically a blues,
you know, it's just a different form.

144
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,603
I was just that...

145
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:18,219
# I can get no satisfaction

146
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:26,118
# I can get me know satisfaction

147
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:31,791
# 'cause I try and I try, yeah I try

148
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:35,966
# I can get no...

149
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:39,645
The sexual swagger of 'Satisfaction'

150
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:42,826
pointed the way
to a new direction in music.

151
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:49,003
Electric blues music was morphing
into something distinctly British.

152
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,195
# And I'm tryin' to make some girl

153
00:11:52,966 --> 00:12:00,314
They pretty much adapted pop-art ideas
to their blues-based R&B

154
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:02,486
and, in a way, invented rock music

155
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:07,972
just by putting pop and R&B together
in a cheeky funny way,

156
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:12,355
with a great backbeat
and a blast off of a riff.

157
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:16,951
Now the blues was being
reexported back to America

158
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,575
introducing the mainstream
to a music they'd previously ignored.

159
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:28,282
We, the young kids in London
and Newcastle and Liverpool,

160
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:35,754
were responsible for putting
a hand inside America's garbage can

161
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:43,100
and pulling out culture which
they were trying their best to crush.

162
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,350
All this was a revelation
to Jimi Hendrix.

163
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:50,593
In 1965 he left the Chitlin' Circuit
and moved to New York

164
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:54,788
where he discovered a new world
of white music coming out of the UK.

165
00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:03,684
Imagine Hendrix walking down somewhere
where there's an import record store.

166
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:07,084
Somebody's just got all these weird
records from England,

167
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:09,621
records by people like the Yardbirds...

168
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:16,067
where guitar players like Jeff Beck
are pursuing many of the same things

169
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:21,338
that Hendrix himself was working on
to do with feedback, distortion,

170
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:26,360
and in some cases maybe taking it further
than Hendrix himself had at that time.

171
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:34,360
The guitarists that most
impressed Hendrix

172
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,165
were Jeff Beck of the Yardbirds
and Eric Clapton.

173
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:47,514
Clapton had gained
a formidable reputation

174
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:50,451
playing with John Mayall
and the Bluesbreakers.

175
00:13:57,077 --> 00:14:02,482
English guitar players showed us, not just
how to play the guitar in a certain way,

176
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,365
but they showed us how it looked.

177
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:07,586
And how it could be sexy,
how it could be forceful.

178
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,368
They were clearly taking influences
from America

179
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,769
but they were showing us something

180
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,617
that we really didn't
know that much about.

181
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:26,401
It wasn't only British
guitar experimentation

182
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:28,807
that was to shape the music
of Jimi Hendrix.

183
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:34,669
While living in Harlem he fell
under the spell of an unlikely hero,

184
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,110
Bob Dylan.

185
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:41,578
Jimi took a copy of 'Blowin' in the wind'
to a Harlem discotheque,

186
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:44,082
totally African-American
experience at the time,

187
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,298
brought this in, went
up to the DJ and said,

188
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:49,345
"I've got this great new track.
Let's play it."

189
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,175
So the DJ puts the song
and the immediate response,

190
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:56,328
everyone was dancing and then
'Blowin' in the wind', "How many...",

191
00:14:56,908 --> 00:15:00,067
Everyone stops, they all look at Jimi,

192
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:04,262
and Jimi literally
has to run from the club for his life.

193
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:05,981
# Johnny's in the basement

194
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:07,392
# Mixing up the medicine

195
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,755
# I'm on the pavement

196
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,064
# Thinking about the government

197
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,452
# The man in the trench coat

198
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,745
# Badge out, laid off

199
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,191
# Says he's got a bad cough

200
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:15,574
# Wants to get it paid off

201
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:16,917
# Look out kid

202
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,259
# It's somethin' you did

203
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,301
# God knows when

204
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:20,776
# But you're doin' it again

205
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,526
# You better duck down the alley way

206
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:23,775
# Lookin' for a new friend

207
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:25,423
# The man in the coon-skin cap

208
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,541
# In the big pen

209
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:27,815
# Wants eleven dollar bills

210
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:29,874
# You only got ten

211
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,120
The song that would define
Dylan in his prime

212
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:36,943
and be pivotal in
the development of Jimi Hendrix

213
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:38,775
is 'Like a Rolling Stone',

214
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:42,388
a tour-de-force that
revolutionized rock music.

215
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:45,617
One of the most exciting
things about it

216
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:48,911
is that opening "bang"
on the snare.

217
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:58,724
You know, it's like a gavel,
a judge wackin' the gavel on his desk,

218
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:03,371
saying, "Ok, History is called to order."

219
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:05,512
# Once upon a time you dressed so fine

220
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:10,997
# You threw the bums a dime
in your prime, didn't you?

221
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:16,277
That's how special, I think the people
involved in that song,

222
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:22,239
not just only Dylan but the producer,
the musicians, everyone knew.

223
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:27,954
# You used to laugh about

224
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:30,892
They say it's the greatest record
of all times.

225
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,484
It's amazing to have played on that.

226
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:39,735
I knew that this stuff would be regarded
as something other than another record.

227
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,442
# Once upon a time you dressed so fine

228
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:50,098
# You threw the bums a dime
in your prime, didn't you?

229
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:56,278
# People'd call, say,
"Beware doll, you're bound to fall"

230
00:16:57,073 --> 00:17:00,396
The character of Dylan's voice
struck a chord with Jimi,

231
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,171
encouraging Hendrix to believe
that he too could make it as a singer.

232
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:08,627
Hendrix had always been
very self-conscious about his singing.

233
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:12,510
He'd worked behind
a lot of great singers,

234
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:14,318
and on the same bill
as a lot of great singers,

235
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:16,671
and he barely considered
himself a singer at all.

236
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:22,986
But when he heard Dylan, he thought,
"Well, if this guy can sing, so can I."

237
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:26,499
# How does it feel

238
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:31,470
# To be on your own

239
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:37,038
# With no direction home

240
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,137
Hendrix heard Dylan and realised
that if a voice has character

241
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:48,947
then it really doesn't matter if
it's a conventional "good voice" or not.

242
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:52,784
If you sound like yourself
and you sound like you mean it,

243
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:54,867
then you can sing rock 'n roll.

244
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:04,032
# Got a feeling inside

245
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:05,689
It was The Who,

246
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:08,721
an uncompromising, loud
and aggressive London band,

247
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:12,149
that would feed most directly
back into the act of Jimi Hendrix.

248
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:16,228
Their high octane performances
gave rock a harder edge.

249
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,442
I think the first band
that I ever truly believed

250
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:24,921
was and out-and-out rock band

251
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,140
that I saw was The Who.

252
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,451
When I saw The Who
play at the Marquee

253
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,424
there was a unity about what they did
with the base, guitar and drums...

254
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,267
and it said to me, this is different,
this is not blues, it's something else.

255
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:48,239
I wouldn't have been able
to categorise it as 'rock' at that time,

256
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,328
but that's really what it was.

257
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:54,137
We were doing feedback
and all that stuff onstage,

258
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:58,236
which came out of putting
all this stuff in a pot, stirring it up,

259
00:18:58,495 --> 00:19:00,951
getting bored with this bit,
doubling up the beat,

260
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,680
banging on a note,
wanging on a chord

261
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,694
and turning the amp until
it fed back and...

262
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,311
away you go.

263
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:14,341
# People try to put us d-down
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

264
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,251
# Just because we get around
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

265
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,016
# Things they do look awful c-c-cold
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

266
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,650
# I hope I die before I get old
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

267
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:30,061
In 'My Generation' they had that
incredible stutter, you know,

268
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:31,519
"Why don't you all f-f-f..."

269
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,674
# Why don't you all f-fade away
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

270
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:41,067
# And don't try to d-dig what we all say
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

271
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:45,879
The stuttering on that record,
I thought was brilliant phrasing.

272
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:50,129
That was their debut in America,
so you heard the record and you went,

273
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:52,526
"He's gotta be putting that on."

274
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:55,982
That couldn't be a guy
that actually stuttered.

275
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:57,468
It was interesting.

276
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,767
# I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-g-generation
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

277
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:07,947
The stutter on 'My Generation' reflects
the frustration and the anger

278
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:09,296
in the attitude of the song.

279
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,187
It's a 'fuck you' moment.

280
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:18,855
This was a complete homage to
the inarticulateness of rebellious youth,

281
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,595
who couldn't speak,
they could hardly think.

282
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:24,904
It's like the old line,
"What are you rebelling against?"

283
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:26,900
"Well, what have you got?"

284
00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:40,742
The Who were actually pivotal
in the development of the new rock.

285
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:46,814
Remember that rock performance
was still more or less in its infancy

286
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:50,266
when the Stones started out in the clubs
they were all sitting on stools.

287
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:53,530
But with The Who there was
an element of real danger.

288
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:59,088
The Who completely altered
notions of rock performance,

289
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:02,621
and also the way that a basic
three instrument band

290
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,214
could look and sound.

291
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:10,877
The Who's total mastery of the stage
and somewhat destructive tendencies

292
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,863
anticipated the wilder
excesses of rock to come.

293
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,544
Jimi Hendrix, for one,

294
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:19,574
would borrow heavily from The Who's
incendiary style of performance.

295
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:26,131
He certainly took an awful
lot of what The Who were doing.

296
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,510
The feedback stuff from Townsend,
he made it his own thing.

297
00:21:30,554 --> 00:21:33,406
But it was kind of weird seeing
a black guy come over from America

298
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:38,693
and look at what we were doing
and take it into his own thing.

299
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:40,490
So the whole thing
had gone a circle.

300
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:48,348
By mid 1966,
Hendrix was going it alone,

301
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:50,500
playing the clubs
in Greenwich Village.

302
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:54,762
He wasn't making much money
but he was gathering a cult audience.

303
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:59,017
Whispers began to circulate
about an extraordinary talent.

304
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:10,948
I once went to the 'Cafe Wha?'
in the Village,

305
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:15,702
that's when I first saw Jimi Hendrix,
and I went, Wow!

306
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:19,185
This guy is good!

307
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:24,416
Among the early Hendrix fan club
was Chas Chandler,

308
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:27,636
the base player of The Animals,
who in the early 60s

309
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:31,268
had been at the forefront of
the British invasion of America.

310
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:39,465
When Chandler discovered
Hendrix in New York

311
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,434
The Animals had already broken up.

312
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:43,543
Chas had gone into management

313
00:22:43,588 --> 00:22:47,332
and was looking for an artist
to cover a Tim Rose folk song,

314
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:49,170
called 'Hey Joe'.

315
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:59,251
# Hey Joe, where you goin'
with that gun in your hand

316
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:02,473
The night Chandler turned up
at the Cafe Wha?

317
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:05,949
he was stunned, not only
by Hendrix's virtuosity,

318
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:08,841
but also by his choice of song.

319
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,939
# Hey Joe, where you goin'
with that gun in your hand

320
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:18,307
The first song Jimi
played was 'Hey Joe',

321
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:20,008
and I was like, you know,

322
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:24,510
I wasn't really conscious
of the rest of the act.

323
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:26,049
I saw a master guitar player.

324
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:27,894
I saw the best guitar player
I'd ever seen in my life.

325
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:32,431
It was that obvious, you know,
I just sat there and went, "Puh!"

326
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:36,838
Let's come to England.
Let me bring him to England.

327
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:42,940
Hendrix would come to London
on one condition.

328
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:50,749
He actually said,
"If I go to England with you,

329
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:53,748
"can you introduce me
to Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton?"

330
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:58,033
And said, "They're pals of me.
I've known them 2-3 years."

331
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:00,602
That was the only question he asked.

332
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:16,289
When Hendrix landed in England
in September 1966,

333
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:19,330
this was ground central
for not just music,

334
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:24,110
but for fashion, photography,
film making, this was...

335
00:24:24,153 --> 00:24:28,183
swinging London in its prime
and Jimi showed up

336
00:24:28,222 --> 00:24:33,483
at the single, most opportune moment
he could have shown up in history.

337
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:40,039
# In the white room with black curtains
near the station.

338
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:45,625
When Hendrix arrived in London,
Cream were the biggest act in town.

339
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:51,404
A power trio comprised of blues
jamming legends Eric Clapton,

340
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,066
bassist Jack Bruce,

341
00:24:57,949 --> 00:25:00,366
and Ginger Baker on drums.

342
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:06,841
# Dawn-light smiles on you leaving,
my contentment.

343
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:10,267
We considered ourselves
to be 'the cream'.

344
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:12,539
We were the guys who could play.

345
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:17,877
Musically we were streets ahead
of any of the others.

346
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:22,656
If we had played music written
by Humpty Dumpty and Mickey Mouse,

347
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:27,453
it would still have been fantastic
because of the musicians playing it.

348
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:35,446
# You said no strings
could secure you at the station.

349
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:43,174
We were very competitive, at that age,
we were like gunslingers or something.

350
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:47,200
I wanted to be the best, most frightening
base player in the world,

351
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:49,662
and I think I was.
I think I succeeded in that.

352
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:51,258
I was certainly the loudest.

353
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:05,453
We would take the language of the blues
and apply it to modern music.

354
00:26:05,645 --> 00:26:08,730
In other words, be very arrogant
about it and nick it,

355
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,476
but not nick actual songs,

356
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,128
we just nicked the feeling and
the language of the blues and used that.

357
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:17,519
Which is very much what
we ended up doing.

358
00:26:27,897 --> 00:26:30,784
What marked this band
as the cream of London,

359
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:35,966
was their flair for improvisation,
playing solos that never seemed to end.

360
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,592
We simply couldn't stop playing.

361
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:50,357
None of us was the band leader
so no one would say "Stop. Enough!"

362
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:53,995
If one of us took off,
let him go.

363
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:59,169
And we'd just go off that direction,
or go off in that direction.

364
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:05,518
We were very much pioneers
of that kind of music.

365
00:27:05,627 --> 00:27:10,449
We built that audience
from nothing really,

366
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:12,982
and the bands that followed us

367
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:17,280
reaped the benefits of
the work that we had done.

368
00:27:19,978 --> 00:27:22,311
Such was Clapton's
prowess on the guitar,

369
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:25,965
fans proclaimed his divinity
on the streets of London.

370
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:31,444
But the guitar god was soon
to be challenged by one of his disciples.

371
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:35,899
Having been in London
for just a week,

372
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:37,771
Jimi went along to a Cream gig,

373
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:42,080
and put in an audacious request
to jam with Clapton.

374
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:44,432
Nobody gets up to jam with Cream.

375
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:47,682
Cream is Mount Olympus,
Cream is the absolute pinnacle.

376
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:49,407
Ordinary mortals cannot breathe

377
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:52,863
that rarified air that exists
in this hallowed space.

378
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,759
The very brave person
who would do that...

379
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,936
As far as I remember,
he plugged in to my base amp

380
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:04,311
and did a version of 'Killing floor'.
A blues all the way of course.

381
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:09,560
Clapton always loved the song
but always thought it was too difficult.

382
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:12,030
And Hendrix just rages through it,

383
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:16,890
and does all his tricks and stunts,
the kind of things that people like

384
00:28:16,925 --> 00:28:19,271
Little Richard and The Isley
Brothers hated him doing.

385
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:23,171
He plays the guitar behind his head,
between his legs, with his teeth...

386
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,569
Feedback, tremolo arm,
dive bombs, the whole works.

387
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,361
He just played his arsehole basically.

388
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:40,318
The first time I saw Eric I thought,
"Ah, there's a master guitar player."

389
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:44,078
But Eric was a guitar player,
Jimi was some sort of force of nature.

390
00:28:45,962 --> 00:28:49,642
Eric just stands there and plays
and then we got this guy, you know,

391
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:55,490
on his knees and playing with his teeth
and screwing the guitar onstage,

392
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,627
and I thought, "God! What is this?"

393
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:01,147
It was like, Wow!, that kind of thing.

394
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:03,313
I know it had a
tremendous effect on Eric.

395
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:05,546
And Eric's hands were
like this on the guitar

396
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:08,040
and they just dropped and he said...

397
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:12,113
He just stood there looking at Jimi.
He walked off the stage

398
00:29:12,162 --> 00:29:15,250
and I thought,
"I knew this was gonna happen."

399
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:20,887
And everybody's just going, "My God!"

400
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:24,642
It's like word goes around,
"This guy got up to jam with Cream

401
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:27,956
and he cut Clapton,
he killed god, man!"

402
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:32,543
I ran backstage and Eric was
standing trying to light a cigarette.

403
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:34,258
And his hands were shaking
and he just says,

404
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:36,141
"Is he really that good?"

405
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:41,373
Chas Chandler was quick to exploit
Jimi's sensational appeal,

406
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:45,543
stealing the thunder of Cream,
he put his own power trio together,

407
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:48,500
flanking Hendrix with
two English musicians,

408
00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:51,549
Mitch Mitchell on drums
and Noel Reading on base,

409
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:55,074
to create
'The Jimi Hendrix Experience'.

410
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:07,429
# Hey Joe, where you goin'
with that gun in your hand

411
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:18,909
# Hey Joe, I said where you goin'
with that gun in your hand

412
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:23,333
'Hey Joe', the song Chas Chandler
had heard Hendrix perform

413
00:30:23,377 --> 00:30:26,431
in obscurity in New York
just six months earlier,

414
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:30,382
entered the UK top ten
in December 1966.

415
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:34,382
It was to be the launchpad
for a meteoric career.

416
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,438
The show he played in America
before he went to England...

417
00:30:58,487 --> 00:30:59,768
there were 12 people there.

418
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:03,909
England a month later, he's attracting
crowds of several hundred.

419
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:08,118
Six months later,
he's the biggest star in the world.

420
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:11,481
No artist, I would argue,
in the history of rock

421
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:13,610
has become famous so quickly.

422
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:25,798
# One pill makes you larger

423
00:31:26,147 --> 00:31:29,990
# And one pill makes you small

424
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:33,652
By the mid point of
the summer of love in 1967,

425
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:35,995
Jimi Hendrix was the toast of London

426
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:39,590
and had become the
psychedelic dandy of flower-power.

427
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,320
But in his home country
he was little known.

428
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:44,358
All that was about to change

429
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:47,609
when Hendrix got the chance
to play the Monterrey Pop Festival

430
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:49,956
sharing the bill with The Who.

431
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,345
There was a bit of jockeying
between him and The Who

432
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:55,894
as to who was to go on when,
because neither band...

433
00:31:56,042 --> 00:32:00,311
Each band had a very healthy
respect for the other's capabilities

434
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:03,107
and neither of them
wanted to follow the other.

435
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:06,180
I said to Jimi, "Fuck it!
We're not going to follow you on."

436
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:08,839
So he said, "I'm not going
to follow you on."

437
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:12,830
So I said, "Listen. We are not
going to follow you on and that's it."

438
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:16,697
So in the end they resolved
the situation by tossing up a coin.

439
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:19,819
Townsend won
and opted to go on first.

440
00:32:24,147 --> 00:32:27,084
We didn't get all this 'peace and love'
shit that was going on there.

441
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,616
That was just a load of rubbish.

442
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:30,126
But the birds were nice.

443
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:35,258
It was like something from outer space.

444
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:38,376
Because not only the music
was totally different,

445
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,931
it was played with all
the aggression of a war.

446
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:51,346
And I think as a piece of theater,
it kind of woke them up.

447
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:55,526
Only Jimi Hendrix could have
followed us, to be honest with you.

448
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:09,630
# You know you're
a cute little heartbreaker

449
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:11,866
# Foxy

450
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:18,889
# You know you're
a sweet little lovemaker

451
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,138
I think what was so dazzling
about Hendrix

452
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:26,275
was the sounds he was creating
and the charismatic spell

453
00:33:26,313 --> 00:33:30,288
that he was casting over
the audience was so extreme

454
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:34,804
that he made everybody else look
as if they were almost trying too hard.

455
00:33:35,505 --> 00:33:38,883
I'd like to bore you for about six
to do a little a thing, you know...

456
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:44,774
Excuse me for a minute.
Just let me play my guitar, all right?

457
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:52,220
It was at this point
that Hendrix reached for Bob Dylan,

458
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:54,773
paying homage to
his song writing hero

459
00:33:54,808 --> 00:33:58,899
with an electrifying performance
of 'Like a Rolling Stone'.

460
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:03,341
# Once upon a time you dressed so fine

461
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:09,466
# You threw the bums a dime
in your prime, didn't you?

462
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:13,705
In a way it was almost
as audacious a thing to do

463
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:17,661
as burning Clapton
on his own stage was.

464
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:20,279
Because people left that song alone.

465
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:23,273
It was one of the all time
monuments of the counter culture.

466
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:25,725
Hendrix comes on playing
this amazing guitar licks

467
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:29,490
sort of drawling the song out
in his own inimitable way.

468
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:38,162
# Look at ya',
a complete unknown

469
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:43,746
# Like a rolling stone

470
00:34:48,015 --> 00:34:49,547
I was a Dylan fan

471
00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:53,454
but 'Like a Rolling Stone'
was one of these Dylan songs

472
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,368
that sort of escaped me
at the time.

473
00:34:56,437 --> 00:35:00,108
It didn't quite work for me...
by Dylan.

474
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:02,791
But when Jimi played it
I understood the song.

475
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,821
It clicked with me
for the first time.

476
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:15,208
The Monterrey audience
was stunned

477
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:18,659
by the sheer explosive power
of Hendrix's performance.

478
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,270
But more was to follow.

479
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,460
As the cameras rolled,
the voodoo magician

480
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,265
had one final trick
up his sleeve.

481
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,103
There's another great moment
that I remember.

482
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:39,673
It was a screening of
the Monterey movie,

483
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:43,343
and happened to be
Eric Clapton and myself

484
00:35:43,378 --> 00:35:46,222
in a little room watching this.

485
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:51,419
When it came time for
'Wild Thing', which he closed with,

486
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:57,943
Jimi sneaks and listens to the guitar,
and it's really not very much in tune,

487
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:05,191
and Clapton yelled,
"Now what are you gonna do?"

488
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:09,250
And he just turned up the guitar

489
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:13,065
and showed Clapton
what he was gonna do.

490
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:24,778
I thought it was an incredible moment.

491
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:32,271
# Wild thing, you make my heart sing

492
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:39,502
# You make a everything, groovy

493
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:42,710
He was such a showman,

494
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:45,442
and his show was so much
the highlight of Monterrey,

495
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:48,393
that it got him in
the headlines immediately,

496
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:52,460
and people were clamouring
to see Jimi Hendrix after that point.

497
00:36:58,976 --> 00:37:01,065
Sacrificing the guitar
at Monterrey

498
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:05,670
was the defining moment of an artist
who had reached his creative peak.

499
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:10,630
On that night Jimi Hendrix
became a rock legend.

500
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,031
I was standing right
next to Robbie Shankle,

501
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:24,532
and I looked around
and his face was like...

502
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:26,669
in shock.

503
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,196
The audience was shocked too.

504
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:33,196
That was the whole idea of the act,
to outdo The Who.

505
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:37,872
Robbie was shocked and disgusted,
you know,

506
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:43,930
how can a musician take his instrument
and smash it to smithereens.

507
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,479
This is bad karma, man.

508
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:58,705
To the wide rock audience that saw
Jimi at Monterrey pop

509
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:01,758
this was the most brilliant show
anybody had ever put on.

510
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:08,527
When he lit that guitar on fire,

511
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:13,123
that became one of the seminal
moments of the 60s.

512
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:27,583
# It was 20 years ago today

513
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:30,580
# Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play

514
00:38:31,398 --> 00:38:33,724
Hendrix was always looking
for a new direction

515
00:38:33,802 --> 00:38:38,022
and when 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band' was released in 1967,

516
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:40,890
he was among the first
to hear its significance.

517
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:45,897
Having stopped touring in '66,
The Beatles had taken refuge in the studio

518
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:51,021
to transform themselves from a pop band
into pioneers of psychedelic rock.

519
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:53,575
What Hendrix saw with
'Sgt. Pepper's'

520
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:58,977
was a band taking control
of its own musical destiny.

521
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:03,756
EMI ageing studios at Abbey Road
played a key role in the process.

522
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:07,097
# We hope you did enjoy the show

523
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,339
The studio at EMI was basically
totally obsolete,

524
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:14,528
and yet the EMI staff knew
everything about it.

525
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:17,111
Knew how to push it to its limits
and how to exploit it.

526
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,612
So it's a very English album.

527
00:39:20,646 --> 00:39:23,867
It's like inventing radar in the potting
shed at the end of the garden.

528
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:26,101
It's very amateurish

529
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:31,452
and yet they were able to produce
something of genius level from it.

530
00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:36,228
# I read the news today,
oh boy

531
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,662
# About a lucky man who made the grade

532
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:45,718
It was like a Heath Robinson
sort of situation.

533
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:48,130
We were tying things together
with bits of string,

534
00:39:48,174 --> 00:39:51,033
and bashing things with hammers
and taping microphones to this,

535
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:56,657
and putting microphones in water,
you name it, we tried it.

536
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,535
It was always this thing about
guitars not sounding like guitars,

537
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,251
and pianos not sounding
like pianos and so on.

538
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:05,057
There's more fun in the record
if there's a few sounds

539
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,846
that you don't really
know what they are.

540
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:09,724
Really they're just instruments,
only something happens on here,

541
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:12,493
I couldn't tell you what 'cause we have
a special man who sits here

542
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:13,763
and goes like this...

543
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,725
And the guitar turns into a piano
or something, you know.

544
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:20,267
And then you always say,
why don't you use a piano?

545
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,308
Because the piano sounds
like a guitar.

546
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:24,999
# Woke up, got out of bed

547
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:27,670
# Dragged a comb across my head

548
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:29,529
They changed everything.

549
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,567
The Beatles were the ones
who changed everything.

550
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:36,405
'Sgt. Pepper', you could argue
is the most important album of the 60s.

551
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,283
# Found my coat and grabbed my hat

552
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:41,442
# Made the bus in seconds flat

553
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:44,272
There was no question that
at the moment it was made,

554
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:50,551
it was the absolute summation
of everything that had come before

555
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:53,896
in say, the previous 4 or 5 years.

556
00:40:54,077 --> 00:41:00,321
'Sgt. Pepper' is an entire reflection
of the society at that time.

557
00:41:00,578 --> 00:41:04,574
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds

558
00:41:05,657 --> 00:41:09,717
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds

559
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:15,022
They were able to... essentially
take drugs without too much censure,

560
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,363
and they could write what they wanted.

561
00:41:17,669 --> 00:41:19,514
The Beatles were tripping
out of their heads.

562
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:23,469
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds

563
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:28,612
I think that knocks down
a lot of barriers in your mind.

564
00:41:28,642 --> 00:41:31,402
You say, "Well, you can't play a C sharp
in a C Chord."

565
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:38,470
But... after you do that,
you can play a C sharp in a C chord.

566
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:47,299
'Sgt. Pepper' is arguably
their greatest record.

567
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:49,211
Certainly their most
influential record.

568
00:41:49,235 --> 00:41:51,709
It stunned Jimi Hendrix more
than almost anyone else.

569
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:56,371
He did, what I think, is the most risky
move he ever did in his entire career.

570
00:41:56,376 --> 00:42:00,141
It was the day after 'Sgt. Pepper's'
had come out,

571
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:03,493
and Jimi had gotten a copy of it
and learned it.

572
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:07,847
He came backstage at this concert
and announced to 'The Experience',

573
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:12,459
we're gonna start our show with a cover
of 'Sgt. Pepper's', the title track.

574
00:42:12,483 --> 00:42:15,807
And Noel Reading told me,
"I just was stunned.

575
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:17,367
"What do you mean?
This album just came out.

576
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,396
"We're gonna cover someone
else's song?"

577
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:22,077
And that's what they started
that concert with.

578
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:26,883
And, to add to it, several of
The Beatles were in the audience.

579
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,427
# It was twenty years ago today,

580
00:42:29,472 --> 00:42:31,927
# Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play

581
00:42:31,956 --> 00:42:34,306
# They've been going in and out of style

582
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:36,516
# But they're guaranteed
to raise a smile.

583
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:39,173
The nerve to do that.

584
00:42:39,237 --> 00:42:43,492
Can you imagine anyone
having the guts to,

585
00:42:43,535 --> 00:42:44,888
The Beatles' album has just come out,

586
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:49,372
universally acclaimed the biggest rock
band in the world that there ever would be,

587
00:42:49,427 --> 00:42:52,965
and for Jimi then to go,
"Ok, the day after it comes out,

588
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:55,027
"I'm gonna play their song
and do it better."

589
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,056
# Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

590
00:43:13,853 --> 00:43:16,215
Hendrix obviously saw that power.

591
00:43:16,258 --> 00:43:20,502
A band that was actually
producing itself now, pretty much.

592
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,766
And said, "Yeah, yeah.
That's for me too."

593
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:30,422
The Beatles had caught
Jimi's imagination

594
00:43:30,472 --> 00:43:32,880
just as powerfully
as Dylan and The Who.

595
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:35,869
Through the sonic revolution
of 'Sgt. Pepper',

596
00:43:35,932 --> 00:43:38,696
Hendrix saw the potential
of the recording studio,

597
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:42,716
believing it could help take his guitar
to a higher level.

598
00:43:44,342 --> 00:43:47,780
# I love your gypsy eyes

599
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:59,750
In 1968, he started recording
'Electric Ladyland'.

600
00:44:04,626 --> 00:44:08,056
# Way up in my tree
I'm sitting by my fire

601
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,923
'Electric Ladyland'
is Hendrix the producer,

602
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:18,161
Hendrix fully embracing the capabilities
of the recording studio

603
00:44:18,206 --> 00:44:24,362
and exploring the kind of soundscapes
he could create in the studio

604
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:31,241
to try to realise on tape the extraordinary
sonic visions he was hearing in his head.

605
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:35,596
One of the high points
of 'Electric Ladyland'

606
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:38,675
found Jimi once again acknowledging
a musical debt

607
00:44:38,714 --> 00:44:43,417
with an apocalyptic version
of Dylan's 'All Along The Watch Tower'.

608
00:44:53,984 --> 00:45:01,572
# "There must be some way out of here,"
said the joker to the thief,

609
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:09,491
# "There's too much confusion,
I can't get no relief.

610
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:12,760
Hendrix had actually
created the scenario itself.

611
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:17,080
Dylan had written the scenario,
Hendrix filled in all the colours.

612
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:21,128
Even Dylan admitted at one point
that 'All Along The Watch Tower'

613
00:45:21,163 --> 00:45:27,767
as Hendrix envisioned it was beyond
the song he had written and recorded.

614
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:34,504
That song, it's as if Jimi wrote it.
You just get the sense.

615
00:45:34,574 --> 00:45:37,847
It's like the song
he was made to play.

616
00:45:41,347 --> 00:45:44,420
Although 'Electric Ladyland'
would be acclaimed a masterpiece,

617
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:47,665
the studio where it was recorded
became a curse.

618
00:45:47,857 --> 00:45:51,372
Hendrix's heavy intake of drugs
began to take its tall.

619
00:45:51,435 --> 00:45:54,180
Some tracks took over 50 takes,

620
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:57,729
and the album hundreds of hours
of recording time.

621
00:46:01,432 --> 00:46:02,873
Things were getting quite freaky.

622
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:05,382
This was peculiar times.

623
00:46:05,427 --> 00:46:06,550
There was an awful lot of...

624
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:11,015
unauthorised substances flying around
with different people and all the rest of it.

625
00:46:12,164 --> 00:46:14,763
You were turning up in the studio
and try to mix tracks

626
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:18,270
and there was 30 and 40 people
turned up as hangers-on.

627
00:46:19,725 --> 00:46:25,271
It was very difficult to be able to talk
about the next step of your life because

628
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:30,594
most of the people were out of
their minds at the time, you know.

629
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:35,340
I just thought, "This is crazy.
I'm spending half my time in the day

630
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,424
"trying to talk common sense
to people and...

631
00:46:38,846 --> 00:46:41,159
"all they want to do
is get out of their minds."

632
00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:44,230
I said, "Well. I'm off back to England.

633
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:46,504
"When you come to your
senses give us a ring."

634
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,749
Minus his manager,
Jimi was left to face the future

635
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:55,631
without the guiding light
that had led him to stardom.

636
00:46:59,907 --> 00:47:05,209
By 1968, the idealism and promise
of 'flower-power' had begun to fade.

637
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:09,788
America was bogged down
in Vietnam and at war with itself.

638
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,867
Torn apart by assassinations
and the civil rights struggle.

639
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:17,299
Europe also saw rioting
on the streets.

640
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:22,311
The drugs got heavier
and so did the music,

641
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:26,076
reflecting the paranoia
and tension in the air.

642
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,584
You could just feel it.
It was very, very different.

643
00:47:28,656 --> 00:47:32,035
The whole atmosphere changed.
Became much more politicised, I think.

644
00:47:32,488 --> 00:47:35,572
No longer could you just be a happy
flower child skipping through Hyde Park

645
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,371
with your daisy chain
and your joss stick

646
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,847
because some cop would come along
and bang you on the head.

647
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,456
Whereas in '67 it was
all ok, you know.

648
00:47:43,888 --> 00:47:46,305
They'd even light
your joint for you.

649
00:47:47,488 --> 00:47:50,453
Mick Jagger and Keith Richard
of course have great instincts

650
00:47:50,523 --> 00:47:52,350
for trends and what's going on.

651
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:57,848
And by 1968 they could see
the trend was for this endarkenment.

652
00:47:58,058 --> 00:48:01,254
The music had to turn darker in response

653
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:04,849
to the darkness
of the times, 1968 and '69.

654
00:48:04,878 --> 00:48:11,741
So, to their great credit, The Rolling
Stones perfectly synched into that.

655
00:48:12,629 --> 00:48:15,523
# Oh, a storm is threatning

656
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:19,078
# My very life today

657
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:23,183
# If I don't get some shelter

658
00:48:23,974 --> 00:48:26,715
# Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

659
00:48:27,627 --> 00:48:33,376
# War, children, it's just a shot away

660
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:35,983
# It's just a shot away

661
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:38,548
The Stones are one
of the few bands that

662
00:48:38,852 --> 00:48:43,588
that darkness kind of gives them
a new creative zenith.

663
00:48:43,622 --> 00:48:45,260
There was a different
world going on there,

664
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,786
but the Stones were
not afraid to embrace,

665
00:48:47,787 --> 00:48:50,050
and somewhat make
that their mistress.

666
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:00,157
When you listen to
'Sympathy for the Devil'

667
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:02,079
it's not like this is a hidden meaning.

668
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:05,491
You have some people are taking records
and playing them backwards

669
00:49:05,516 --> 00:49:08,456
to look for satanic messages.
With the Stones it's right there.

670
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:12,938
They're not afraid to touch on
that darkness.

671
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:17,867
# Please allow me to introduce myself

672
00:49:17,893 --> 00:49:21,769
# I'm a man of wealth and taste

673
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:25,956
# I've been around for a long, long year

674
00:49:26,014 --> 00:49:29,670
# Stole many a man's soul and faith

675
00:49:30,428 --> 00:49:34,612
They're the band, strangely,
that survives and actually feeds off

676
00:49:34,647 --> 00:49:41,627
the dark drug elements that came in
and destroyed the rest of the scene.

677
00:49:43,485 --> 00:49:46,889
# Please allow me to introduce myself

678
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:51,197
# I'm a man of wealth and taste

679
00:49:52,546 --> 00:49:55,973
By the time The Rolling Stones
came to play Altamont Festival

680
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:59,855
in December 1969,
heavy drugs and bad trips

681
00:49:59,922 --> 00:50:02,114
were destroying the hippy dream.

682
00:50:02,193 --> 00:50:06,594
And now Hell's Angels touting
knives and guns were on the scene.

683
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:11,000
Hired as security, they turned what
was meant to be a peace loving event

684
00:50:11,055 --> 00:50:14,997
into one of the most violent days
in rock history.

685
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:20,693
A Stones fan was stabbed to death
by a Hell's Angel.

686
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:25,021
Never had 'Sympathy for the Devil'
seemed a more appropriate song.

687
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:32,685
<i>We're splitting man if those cats
don't stop beating everybody up inside.</i>

688
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,930
<i>I want them out of the way, man!</i>

689
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:38,011
<i>I don't like you!</i>

690
00:50:38,418 --> 00:50:42,403
I think the closing of that era
was probably Altamont.

691
00:50:44,443 --> 00:50:51,489
And that really sort of tied it up
with a black bow,

692
00:50:52,343 --> 00:50:53,806
and that's it.

693
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,946
Things got very
business-like after that.

694
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:02,178
That free spirit died at Altamont.

695
00:51:06,995 --> 00:51:09,260
Altamont had been planned to replicate

696
00:51:09,305 --> 00:51:12,156
the utopian spirit of
the Woodstock Festival

697
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:16,123
that had taken place in New York St.
just four months before.

698
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:19,599
It was here that Jimi Hendrix
would make history

699
00:51:19,657 --> 00:51:24,057
unleashing a searing rendition
of the Star-Spangled Banner.

700
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,664
Hendrix climaxed the festival

701
00:51:48,726 --> 00:51:51,875
with this performance of
the Star-Spangled Banner

702
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:59,390
which, I would say, is the greatest
American work of art

703
00:51:59,462 --> 00:52:02,120
to deal with the Vietnam War

704
00:52:02,154 --> 00:52:08,056
and the titanic struggles
of the civil rights movement,

705
00:52:08,144 --> 00:52:13,065
in any art form
by any artist.

706
00:52:18,283 --> 00:52:21,561
Jimi's tortured take
on the American National anthem

707
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:24,763
was seen by many
to be a political statement

708
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:28,092
about the horror the US
was inflicting on Vietnam.

709
00:52:28,184 --> 00:52:31,978
His howling guitar echoing
the sounds of helicopters,

710
00:52:32,057 --> 00:52:34,660
bombs and machine-guns.

711
00:52:36,803 --> 00:52:40,281
This man was in the 101st Airborne
so when you write your nasty letters in...

712
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,791
Nasty letters? Why...?

713
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:44,026
Well, when you mention
the National Anthem

714
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,810
and talk about playing
it in any unorthodox way,

715
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:50,753
immediately get a guaranteed percentage
of hate mail from people to say

716
00:52:50,787 --> 00:52:52,771
- how dare...?
- But listen, that's not unorthodox.

717
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,634
- It isn't unorthodox?
- No, no.

718
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:57,278
I thought it was beautiful,
but then, there you go...

719
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:08,990
To some critics, the sound
of Hendrix's distorted guitar

720
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:12,764
was also symbolic of the muddy
reality of Woodstock.

721
00:53:13,308 --> 00:53:14,963
Drenched by torrential rain,

722
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:18,624
the event hyped as three
days of peace and love

723
00:53:18,648 --> 00:53:20,922
had more the look of a war zone.

724
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,919
We think of this moment as being
the great moment of the 60s.

725
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:28,358
Everyone coming together.
Oh here's Jimi Hendrix playing.

726
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,279
Well, while he was playing
the Star-Spangled Banner

727
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:32,996
people are streaming out of the venue.

728
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:36,433
It's a muddy field.
There are only a handful of people left.

729
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,359
That's the difference
between, of course,

730
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,761
the reality of what it would
have been like to be there,

731
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:46,315
and the reality of now looking back
at the footage and what we remembered as.

732
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:49,695
But we as pundits and writers
and film makers go back

733
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,525
and it's hard not
to think of that, in retrospect,

734
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:54,404
as being the end of a decade.

735
00:53:54,643 --> 00:53:57,967
To Jimi, he left the stage
exhausted and collapsed,

736
00:53:57,996 --> 00:54:00,551
and maybe that's a good metaphor

737
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,436
for what the 60s had become
for everybody at that point.

738
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:09,478
Jimi Hendrix would never again
match the emotional high of Woodstock.

739
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,283
Burnt out on drugs and exhaustion,

740
00:54:12,322 --> 00:54:15,416
he'd become tired of
the attention-grabbing stage tricks

741
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:18,298
that audiences constantly
demanded of him.

742
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,170
I don't care, man.
I don't care what they say any more.

743
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:27,169
It's up to them. If they want to mess up
the evening by looking at one thing...

744
00:54:28,027 --> 00:54:30,593
Because all that is included, man,
when I feel like with my teeth

745
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:32,289
I do it. because I feel like it.

746
00:54:33,196 --> 00:54:37,239
When I'm onstage, I'm a complete
natural, more so than

747
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:39,309
talking to a group of people
or something.

748
00:54:41,082 --> 00:54:44,838
By August 1970,
the sparkle had gone.

749
00:54:44,898 --> 00:54:48,892
Hendrix returned to England
to play the Isle of Wight Festival.

750
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:53,499
Dosed heavily on LSD, he gave
a lacklustre performance.

751
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:58,273
It would be the his last appearance
in the country that had made him a star.

752
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:02,113
I was actually at that show

753
00:55:02,114 --> 00:55:05,702
and I'd been waiting,
like everybody else,

754
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:09,594
for Hendrix to come on
and lift our spirits,

755
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:12,147
set light to the whole event.

756
00:55:12,191 --> 00:55:16,386
But when he came on. it seemed like
everything was going wrong.

757
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:22,154
He seemed exhausted, he was having
sort of to drag out all his old songs,

758
00:55:22,254 --> 00:55:24,395
his gear was malfunctioning.

759
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,775
He couldn't get the sound
he wanted out of his amps.

760
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:40,930
You could almost see the life
ebbing out of him the longer he's onstage.

761
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:56,114
There was an awful finale, see,
to the whole thing.

762
00:55:56,183 --> 00:56:01,237
Remember Jim Morrison was dead,
Janis Joplin was dead,

763
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:02,860
The Beatles had broke up,

764
00:56:02,913 --> 00:56:05,189
it seemed like
all the furniture of the 60s

765
00:56:05,247 --> 00:56:08,070
was being put out
on the pavement outside.

766
00:56:15,344 --> 00:56:18,564
On the morning of
September 18th, 1970,

767
00:56:18,627 --> 00:56:23,113
almost exactly 4 years to the day
he'd first arrived in London,

768
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:25,503
Jimi Hendrix was found dead

769
00:56:25,543 --> 00:56:29,602
in the basement of the Samarkand Hotel
in Notting Hill.

770
00:56:29,705 --> 00:56:34,630
# And the clowns have all gone to bed

771
00:56:36,236 --> 00:56:40,180
His death was undignified,
drowned in vomit,

772
00:56:40,235 --> 00:56:43,597
unconscious from
a combination of red wine

773
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:47,033
and an accidental
overdose of sleeping pills.

774
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:50,793
He was 27 years old.

775
00:56:57,034 --> 00:57:00,235
Jimi Hendrix was a weak man,
that was his problem.

776
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:03,285
And the weakness made him vulnerable.

777
00:57:03,614 --> 00:57:06,468
And vulnerable people in
rock music don't last long.

778
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:10,318
There might be good people,
there might be nice people,

779
00:57:10,387 --> 00:57:12,298
but they don't last...
You've gotta be tough

780
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:14,633
in the rock music business
to survive.

781
00:57:15,294 --> 00:57:17,104
The night that he died,

782
00:57:18,497 --> 00:57:22,743
I was supposed to meet him
at the Lyceum to see Sly Stone play,

783
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:26,614
and I brought with me
a left handed Stratocaster,

784
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:30,638
I'd just found it.
I think I bought it at Orange Music.

785
00:57:30,703 --> 00:57:33,845
I'd never seen one before
and I was gonna give it to him.

786
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:38,406
And he was in a box over there
and I was in a box over here

787
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:43,597
and I could see him
but we never got together.

788
00:57:43,602 --> 00:57:48,092
The next day he was gone and I was
left with that left handed Stratocaster.

789
00:58:05,189 --> 00:58:08,807
The death of Jimi Hendrix
was the final curtain.

790
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:14,081
Drawing to a close an unprecedented
period of creativity.

791
00:58:16,052 --> 00:58:20,506
The 60s had given birth
to the First Age of Rock.

792
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:26,138
Presiding over it all, was the genius
and showmanship of Jimi Hendrix.

793
00:58:28,975 --> 00:58:32,487
Jimi Hendrix would prove
a hard act to follow.

794
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,470
# Well, I stand up next to a mountain

795
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:39,343
# And I chop it down
with the edge of my hand

796
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:49,734
Next week on
Seven Ages of Rock,
