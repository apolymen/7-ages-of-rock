1
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:40,545
It's the early 1970s.

2
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,964
And a force is sweeping through rock

3
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:46,150
with a sound big enough
to fill football stadiums.

4
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,890
Its name, Led Zeppelin.

5
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:53,755
A group that will become the first
gladiators of Stadium Rock.

6
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:57,010
# It's been a long time
since I rock-and-rolled

7
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,498
# It's been a long time
since I did the Stroll

8
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:08,941
# Ooh, let me get it back,
let me get it back, let me get it back

9
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,290
# mm-baby, where I come from

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,332
For the next 20 years,
stadium rock will be an elite club

11
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:19,300
with only a handful of
ambitious bands can hope to join.

12
00:01:26,824 --> 00:01:28,931
Do you believe in rock 'n roll?

13
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:32,452
For this groups,
size really does matter.

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,597
It is arrogance
with a cock.

15
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:45,571
These are performers who specialize
in driving audiences wild.

16
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:48,870
It's the greatest job in the world!

17
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:56,759
But they will discover through
a global stadium rock show

18
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:00,176
that their music isn't just being
listened to around the world

19
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:02,720
but might also help change it.

20
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:05,564
We had the whole planet.

21
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:09,443
And it turns out that
the 'lingua franca' of the world

22
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:11,726
is not English,
it's rock 'n roll.

23
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:16,587
This is the story
of the age of Stadium Rock.

24
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:19,713
When a succession of great artists

25
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:22,210
took the music
onto a global stage

26
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,920
and played for the higher
stakes possible.

27
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:28,593
You are sort of like
the Aztec Sun Prince.

28
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:31,854
You're there in your palace
but you know

29
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:33,848
when the year's up,
the priest is gonna come,

30
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:37,198
drag you out, take you up the pyramid
and cut your heart out with a knife.

31
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:41,615
# ...of the world.

32
00:02:54,052 --> 00:03:00,957
# There's a lady who's sure
all that glitters is gold

33
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,849
# And she's buying a stairway to heaven

34
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:10,163
Led Zeppelin came to America
at the end of the 60s,

35
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:15,801
and by 1973 were playing to audiences
of over 50,000 people.

36
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:23,304
On stage, singer Robert Plant,
combined power and intimacy

37
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:27,181
to create a magical vibe
that defined stadium rock.

38
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:33,725
# And she's buying
a stairway to heaven

39
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:36,675
Great stadium rock is really
about the universal.

40
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,655
It's about having those songs
that the whole world wants to sing.

41
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,819
Sometimes it lacks the subtlety
and refinement that gets critics excited

42
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:49,334
and they tend to be quite
harsh about stadium rock,

43
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:52,099
it's almost become
a term of abuse.

44
00:03:52,152 --> 00:03:57,006
And yet, the great stadium rock bands
take it beyond a big show,

45
00:03:57,206 --> 00:04:02,041
they take it into the realm
of spirit and substance.

46
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:05,070
But I've got some good news.
Listen!

47
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,914
# If there's a bustle in your hedgerow,
don't be alarmed now,

48
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:15,428
# It's just a spring clean
for the May Queen

49
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:22,237
I remember seeing Led Zeppelin
and it was really a religious experience.

50
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:25,573
It was so perfect,

51
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:29,362
and so much everything that I would
ever want to aspire to be.

52
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:34,194
Backstage, Zeppelin's manager,
Peter Grunt,

53
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:36,759
scourge of concert
promoters around the world,

54
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,334
would be working
his own kind of magic.

55
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:42,008
Don't fucking talk to me,
it's my bloody act!

56
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:45,325
I think I'll leave you anytime. You
couldn't even give them a starting line.

57
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:48,224
You are the fucking controller
of the thing, aren't you?

58
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:53,012
For concert promoters, Grunt was
an intimidating and infamous figure.

59
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:56,458
But he would have a lasting
impact on the business of rock.

60
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:00,454
You rented it and you controlled it.

61
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:03,217
Isn't selling fucking
pirate posters.

62
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,088
Led Zeppelin were a monumentally
important band.

63
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:08,594
They literally changed the economics.

64
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:11,225
They said, we'll take 90%
and you'll keep 10%,

65
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:13,050
to the promoters,
which was an inversion

66
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:14,125
of the way it had always worked.

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,196
And they had the nerve
and the toughness to do it.

68
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:19,114
And they were such a powerful draw,
that having 10% of Led Zeppelin

69
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:21,589
was still worth it to the promoters.

70
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:30,031
The big bands of the era
followed Zeppelin's lead,

71
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:32,202
both The Who and The Rolling Stones

72
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:35,794
found the emphasis of their career
shifting from making records

73
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,494
to filling the largest spaces possible.

74
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:42,991
These were, as it were,
slightly old guard,

75
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:47,404
these were people who had been
big towards the end of the 1960s.

76
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:50,930
But they in turn inspired
new generations.

77
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,509
# I see a little silhouette of a man

78
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:57,113
# Scaramouch, scaramouch
will you do the fandango

79
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,784
# Thunderbolt and lightning
- very very frightening me

80
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:06,918
# Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

81
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:13,220
1975 was the year the group Queen
emerged onto the world's stage.

82
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,182
'Bohemian Rhapsody' brought comparisons
with the epics of Led Zeppelin.

83
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,720
On tour in Japan, they were hailed
as visiting gods.

84
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:28,453
We got on the plane, a young,
up-and-coming, hopeful group in England,

85
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:31,860
and we got off the plane in Tokyo
like The Beatles.

86
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,186
It was very...
blindingly strange.

87
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:41,949
# Oh mama mia, mama mia,
mama mia let me go

88
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:46,251
We're completely overwhelmed
by what's happened since we came here.

89
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:48,693
It's never happened to us
in any other country.

90
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,831
Most groups, at that point,
were very much against

91
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:05,023
putting on any kind of show.

92
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:07,129
It was very much like,
let's get into our music, man,

93
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,551
and everything else
can take a back seat.

94
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:12,389
We weren't like that.
We thought, "No. We entertain people."

95
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:16,488
# A baby I was when you took my hand

96
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:19,601
# And the light of
the night burned bright

97
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:23,514
# And the people all
stared didn't understand

98
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:26,953
# But you knew my name on sight

99
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:30,839
Queen's live act was centered
around singer Freddy Mercury,

100
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:34,291
one of the greatest frontmen
in the history of rock.

101
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:37,935
People actually believed
when he first used to come on sort of...

102
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:39,648
Hell thunderbolts!

103
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:47,815
And we used to dress somebody up
as Freddy and just flash a light,

104
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,364
and now I'm here,
now I'm there,

105
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:51,532
and of course,
one of them was him.

106
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,326
It seemed almost
like a magic show.

107
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:07,669
The thing about it that
I loved mostly was that

108
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:10,478
he wasn't asking your permission,
he simply was saying,

109
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:12,843
this is who I am,
take it or leave it.

110
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,583
That's what rock...
It's putting your chin out and say,

111
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,634
"Go ahead, take your best shot."

112
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,878
Queen's show always ended
with the audience demanding more.

113
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:29,803
And it was this ritual
which inspired Brian May

114
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:33,054
to write the most famous
stadium anthem of them all.

115
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:37,391
There was a place called
Bingley Hall, near Birmingham,

116
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:38,709
which we used to play,

117
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,264
and one night it was packed
and heaving and sweaty.

118
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:43,706
It was an amazing gig.

119
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,668
And when we came off
they didn't stop singing.

120
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:47,840
They were singing to us.

121
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,665
They were singing
'You'll never walk alone'.

122
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,719
And we all looked at
each other and thought,

123
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,401
"Something is really happening here.
This is a complete interaction."

124
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:59,552
And that night I woke up
in the middle of the night

125
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:03,349
thinking, what would an audience do
if you gave them permission,

126
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:04,622
what would they do.

127
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:09,043
They could stand, they could clap,
they could sing something

128
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:11,203
which made them feel they were
bonded together,

129
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:13,051
something which made them
feel strong.

130
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:17,791
# We will, we will rock you

131
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:21,066
Come on! Sing it everybody!

132
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:24,271
# We will, we will rock you

133
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:28,278
I think it was very stripped down
bareness of it.

134
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,478
It was just sort of
caught people.

135
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:35,873
You know, "Rock!"

136
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,233
When it was played live,

137
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,716
'We will rock you' would segue
into a song of Freddy Mercury's,

138
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:48,393
the equally bombastic,
'We are the Champions'.

139
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,834
# We are the champions, my friend

140
00:09:57,081 --> 00:10:03,918
# And we'll keep on fighting
till the end

141
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,359
The songs would provide
an explosive concert finale

142
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,369
for the rest of Queen's career.

143
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,086
'We will rock you' and
'We are the champions'

144
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:20,683
are triumphalist rock songs.

145
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:28,698
It is all about the communication,
the empathy, the energy exchange,

146
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:32,101
between thousands of people
in a stadium

147
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:35,819
and that larger-than-life
character on the stage.

148
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,310
# We are the champions

149
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:43,297
That is the essence of stadium rock.

150
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:52,378
# No time for losers,
'cause we are the champions...

151
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:57,476
# of the world.

152
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:22,695
The sports arenas of the USA
were stadium rock spiritual home.

153
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:25,512
And both 'We will rock you' and
'We are the champions'

154
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:27,933
became an eternal part
of their culture.

155
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,611
It was in the 1970s

156
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:35,624
that American bands created
a brand of theatrical rock

157
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:37,723
purpose-built for these venues.

158
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:40,277
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

159
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:45,844
American stadium rock is really
just rock as grand entertainment.

160
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:50,002
In America you get
a tradition that gives you Aerosmith,

161
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:52,865
and ultimately gives you Bon Jovi.

162
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,245
Or it gives you Kiss.

163
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:58,532
Just the theater of rock
without any substance.

164
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,808
# You show us everything you've got

165
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:07,186
# You keep on dancin
and the room gets hot

166
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:12,107
# You drive us wild,
we'll drive you crazy

167
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:14,558
Kiss were four glam rock fans

168
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:16,851
who hit upon the idea
of using makeup

169
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:20,332
to transform themselves into
larger-than-life rock stars.

170
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,134
The plan was to create an illusion.

171
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:29,611
Because if you can get people
to believe what they're seeing

172
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:33,829
is more than what it is,
it becomes more than it is.

173
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:41,054
# I wanna rock and roll all nite
and party every day

174
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:45,141
Kiss were hated by
music critics,

175
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:47,328
but built up a fan base of millions,

176
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:51,449
because their shows could successfully
entertain tens of thousands of people.

177
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,323
It's not spontaneous.
Everything is scripted.

178
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:57,581
The focus is not necessarily
on the music.

179
00:12:57,681 --> 00:13:00,178
The frontman basically
is barely playing.

180
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,450
He misses more notes than he hits.

181
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,748
The emphasis is on the spectacle.

182
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:10,796
I could care less whether
'New Musical Express'

183
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:14,812
or some other music magazine
believes that what we do is valid.

184
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:19,387
A billion dollars later,
they can kiss my ass, baby!

185
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,679
The band was deliberately marketed

186
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,540
outside the ghetto
of hardcore rock fans.

187
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:30,871
This is Kiss.
Each sold separately.

188
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:33,823
And you can put them
in any crazy pose you want.

189
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,012
They were, with the Kiss dolls,
appealing to people who were 4.

190
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:41,659
Literally they had no relationship
to rock music,

191
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,626
they would not be able
to say what rock music was

192
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,784
and they may have owned
the Kiss dolls.

193
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,894
They blow fire and spit blood and...

194
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,451
- And that's neat, uh?
- Yeah.

195
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:56,306
At their peak, Kiss earned $50 million
a year from merchandise alone.

196
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,061
Their products could be found
everywhere.

197
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:02,402
Even in the dressing room of the man
who would eventually deliver

198
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:05,872
stadium rock from this glam
and platform heel phase,

199
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,558
Bruce Springsteen.

200
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:14,978
Bruce Springsteen was one
of the first people viewed as

201
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:18,411
being necessary to save
rock 'n roll.

202
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:21,008
He was a good looking guy,
writing great songs,

203
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:25,785
who seemed, more than anything else,
relentlessly sincere.

204
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:29,941
He is the 70s rock Dylan.

205
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,773
# Don't run back inside,

206
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:36,323
# you know just what I'm here for

207
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:40,448
# So you're scared and you're thinking

208
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:44,886
# That maybe we ain't
that young anymore

209
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:49,167
# Show a little faith
there's magic in the night

210
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,976
# You ain't a beauty but hey
you're alright

211
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:59,126
# And that's alright with me

212
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,372
# You can hide 'neath your covers
and study your pain

213
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,492
Bruce Springsteen and his group
the E Street Band,

214
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:11,021
had no need for costumes
or pyrotechnics.

215
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:14,299
Songs like 'Thunder Road'
were widescreen tales

216
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,190
of escape and freedom.

217
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,552
The honesty of the music
he played...

218
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:25,714
You know, there wasn't a lot of fanfare
and smoke and mirrors and bullshit.

219
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:27,558
It was some guys
on that stage,

220
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:30,503
putting their heart and soul
into what they were doing.

221
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:33,010
# Except roll down the window

222
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,615
# And let the wind blow
back your hair

223
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,012
# Well the night's busting open

224
00:15:40,112 --> 00:15:44,858
# These two lanes
will take us anywhere

225
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:48,204
# We got one last chance
to make it real

226
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:52,530
# To trade in these wings
on some wheels

227
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:54,642
# Climb in back

228
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,620
# Heaven's waiting on down the tracks

229
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:01,607
Springsteen wore his heart
on his sleeve,

230
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:04,880
but also tapped into the common
experiences of a generation

231
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,332
coming of age in America
in the 1970s.

232
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,704
That moment in the 70s

233
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:13,931
was a moment of crashed
expectations in America.

234
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:16,669
We were told there was no more
oil on the ground.

235
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:18,943
The speed limit had been
dropped to 55

236
00:16:19,143 --> 00:16:25,209
and Watergate and the fall of Vietnam
were just the icing on the cake.

237
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:28,497
From now on it's just gonna be
work in a rotten job

238
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:30,647
for not enough money
and inflation's going wild,

239
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:33,219
and you're never gonna be able
to have your own house.

240
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:34,968
It was just like,
"The fun is over!"

241
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,003
# It's town full of losers

242
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:40,600
# And I'm pulling out of here to win

243
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,512
Springsteen came out
of the music scene

244
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:51,165
centered around the troubled
New Jersey resort of Asbury Park.

245
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,044
A town scarred by race
riots at the start of the 1970s,

246
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:58,204
and in a downward spiral.

247
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:02,187
I was a loner.
I didn't really fit in very well,

248
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,980
and so it was through music

249
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:07,212
that I fundamentally connected
myself to my world,

250
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:09,039
to the world that was out there.

251
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:14,698
I had my... where my ideas
and my actions had some impact.

252
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:18,797
It was basically street music.

253
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:21,587
That's where it came from.

254
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:26,777
In 1975, Springsteen had been
a struggling figure

255
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:29,325
on the verge of being dropped
by his record label.

256
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:32,392
But with the album and single
'Born to Run'

257
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:35,330
he turned his career round
in unprecedented fashion.

258
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,797
I knew when I heard that song,

259
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:43,897
ok, we have a whole new
thing going on here.

260
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:47,140
This is not just a song,
this is a movie soundtrack.

261
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:53,724
# In the day we sweat it out in
the streets of a runaway American dream

262
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:59,856
# At night we ride through mansions
of glory in suicide machines

263
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,435
# Sprung from cages out on highway 9,

264
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:05,020
# Chrome wheeled, fuel injected

265
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,709
# and steppin' out over the line

266
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:12,579
# Baby this town rips
the bones from your back

267
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,503
# It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

268
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:18,086
# We gotta get out while we're young

269
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,797
# 'Cause tramps like us,
baby we were born to run

270
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:27,142
'Born to Run', a street anthem
song with real passion,

271
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:31,082
turned Springsteen into the most
talked about performer in America.

272
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:34,761
Bruce really was
uncomfortable with it.

273
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:37,169
He wanted it but not that way.

274
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:41,442
He wanted it more in his own terms.
He wanted it to go a little slower.

275
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,834
It seemed that it was
getting out of hand for him.

276
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:47,719
When 'Born to Run' hit,
Springsteen was still playing theaters,

277
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:50,268
places that held no more
than 2000 people.

278
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:53,805
Now, as a star turn,
he could fill arenas,

279
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:56,298
venues that held up to 20,000.

280
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,976
But Springsteen drew back,

281
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:02,853
fearful of losing his personal
connection with the audience.

282
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:08,120
He seemed to be really weary
of taking any steps too fast.

283
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,708
He stayed in clubs
when he could be filling theaters.

284
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:14,727
He stayed in theaters for a long time
when he could be playing arenas.

285
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:18,955
He didn't move to arenas until
he really knew he could do it right.

286
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,621
You're trying to get around
to as many cities as you can.

287
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:27,134
That's what's best for the fans.

288
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:30,994
Yeah, you can stay in a club,

289
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:33,541
and play that club
30 nights in a row,

290
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:39,334
or you can play 6 nights
in the theater,

291
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:41,704
or one night in the arena,
you know what I mean?

292
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:45,419
# Rosalita jump a little lighter

293
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,318
# Señorita come sit by my fire

294
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:51,313
# I just want to be
your love, ain't no lie

295
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:54,210
# Rosalita you're my stone desire

296
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,959
It was on his first major
arena tour in 1978

297
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,806
that Springsteen learnt
to love the big stage.

298
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:06,639
When he went out there
and it felt good,

299
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,930
it was a delight to him.

300
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:14,240
He figured out that size was not
the obstacle that he thought it was.

301
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,458
That the shape of the building
was not the issue.

302
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:24,287
It was the shape of the music
and the shape of what he projected.

303
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:27,062
And you could see it worked.

304
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:37,395
The band's three hour set
would climax with the song 'Rosalita'.

305
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:41,389
Springsteen used it as an opportunity
to pull out every stop.

306
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,252
It just did everything, you know.

307
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:10,425
It's all this big story,
it was funny, it was silly.

308
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:14,306
There were many different arrangemental
things that just simply

309
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,775
was meant to drive you crazy.

310
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:00,264
By the end of the 70s
it was becoming clear

311
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:04,163
that stadium rock could embrace
both the blue-collar epics of Springsteen

312
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:07,313
and the camp theatrics
of Kiss and Queen.

313
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,509
But on the streets of London

314
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:13,454
a group had formed who would
broaden stadium rock even more

315
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:16,266
by bringing their own
global take to the music,

316
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:19,033
The Police.

317
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:25,647
# Roxanne, you don't have
to put on the red light

318
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:28,742
# Those days are over

319
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,162
# You don't have to sell
your body to the night

320
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:34,059
The Police are significant because

321
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,397
they actually did bring
a new sound to stadium rock.

322
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:41,478
That there was a reggae tinge to it
was different because

323
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:44,364
when you talk about stadium rock,
you are talking about rock;

324
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,760
this are white guys with guitars.

325
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,600
Now, The Police were white
guys with guitars,

326
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,858
but they had also clearly heard
a few reggae records in their time.

327
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:59,196
# Roxanne, you don't have
to put on the red light

328
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,768
Stewart Copeland had founded
The Police in 1977,

329
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:06,288
along with base
playing frontman, Sting.

330
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:09,368
They were soon joined
by guitarist Andy Summers.

331
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:14,268
The exotic rhythms that propelled
The Police's early classic, 'Roxanne',

332
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:17,494
came naturally to Copeland,
who'd grown up in the Middle East.

333
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:23,456
# Roxanne, you don't have
to put on the red light

334
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:31,274
Since I grew up with backward rhythm,
our rhythms were slightly out of kelter.

335
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:34,086
Instead of... Roxanne

336
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:36,967
It was Roxanne...

337
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:41,985
# Roxanne, you don't have
to wear that dress tonight

338
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,150
The base, which goes...

339
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,407
move it over one beat,
so it goes...

340
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,520
Real simple.

341
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:58,581
'Roxanne' was first released
in April, 1978,

342
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:00,804
but would not be an immediate hit.

343
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:03,489
The British music scene
was dominated by punk

344
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:05,912
and 'Roxanne' simply didn't fit in.

345
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:09,528
A lot of the hacks then
just wouldn't give us a shot.

346
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:12,728
We were just about finished
as a band, you know,

347
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,661
we couldn't get gigs really.

348
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:17,724
If we got a gig, we'd have to spend
all the money hiring the PA

349
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,326
and the van to get there.

350
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:22,103
As a last roll of the dice,

351
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:26,789
The Police decided to chance their luck
with a self-financed American tour.

352
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,640
It felt different when
we came to the US.

353
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,444
It felt like it was a clean slate.

354
00:24:31,544 --> 00:24:34,470
People accepted us just
on the music alone.

355
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,044
They didn't care about punk
credentials or anything like that.

356
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,868
They just reacted to the music.

357
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,502
# And all this guilt will be on your head

358
00:24:42,602 --> 00:24:45,434
# I guess you'd call it suicide

359
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:48,635
# But I'm too full to swallow my pride

360
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,478
# I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

361
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:54,546
# I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

362
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:57,619
# I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

363
00:24:57,794 --> 00:25:00,737
They responded to our music,
and just city by city,

364
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:02,936
incrementally, tour after tour.

365
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:05,565
You know, people imagine that
it happened suddenly. It wasn't.

366
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,059
It was a lot of shows.
It was step by step by step.

367
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:13,599
They drove around in a van.

368
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:19,046
They played every crappy bar
and kept coming back, and back, and back.

369
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:21,695
I knew people who thought
The Police were from Boston,

370
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:26,009
because they played in the New York
to Boston corridor so much.

371
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:32,251
<i>The Police at the far corner
of the store, here to say "hello".</i>

372
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:33,763
<i>Come over to meet them...</i>

373
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:36,716
The group's progress in the US

374
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:39,702
immediately reflected back
in their British record sales.

375
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:41,563
And within a year of going
to America

376
00:25:41,663 --> 00:25:44,330
the band would be
a number one act in the UK.

377
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,332
But Stewart's brother, Miles,
the group's manager,

378
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:50,781
had a plan that would take them global.

379
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,797
There were two things that
were really important.

380
00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:56,054
Number one is, when you
interview the group,

381
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,940
most groups had the same
thing to say.

382
00:25:58,577 --> 00:26:00,124
How did you get your name,
what did you do,

383
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:01,466
it was always the same story.

384
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:03,085
Yeah, we formed this
little group and friends

385
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,741
we went playing at the Marquee Club
and we did this and that...

386
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:08,426
I heard that one before, ok?

387
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,866
So, to put the group in situation

388
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,823
where they've done something
nobody else has done,

389
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:13,534
means that any time they do
an interview,

390
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:15,145
the interviews are much
more interesting.

391
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:17,221
Secondly, if you would
put them in a situation

392
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:20,098
where the photographs
are gonna be interesting.

393
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:24,105
You've got a picture of them in Delhi
wearing maharaja suits,

394
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,685
you go, "Wow! The Police are touring
the world. My God! They're in India.

395
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,230
"They're in Egypt. They're... God!"

396
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:31,911
It just created this mystique
of excitement.

397
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:35,890
The Police's 1980 world tour
saw them play countries

398
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:39,042
where few Western rock acts
had ever performed.

399
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:42,149
# I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

400
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:45,621
# I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

401
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,982
This morning we left Bombay

402
00:26:49,182 --> 00:26:52,729
and we will be landing in Cairo
in about three hours.

403
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:56,334
I think we should just... get off,
you know, let's go.

404
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,794
It was fantastic fun.

405
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:03,958
Everywhere was total mayhem
as we went around and enjoyed this

406
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:09,112
but as well as the fun of it
it was very press worthy.

407
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,390
<i>It's nice to be here in Athens.</i>

408
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,039
By 1981, The Police had built
an international following,

409
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:21,386
and the band's enormous potential
was starting to be recognised

410
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:23,052
by the rock establishment.

411
00:27:25,114 --> 00:27:27,040
Freddy was very taken, you know.

412
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,295
And he got hold of a video
of The Police and said,

413
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:33,401
"Look. Look at this guy. Look at Sting.
Look what a showman he is.

414
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:36,427
"This guy is gonna be the next
whatever it is, you know."

415
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:46,782
The Police were not the only ones looking
beyond Britain and America for success.

416
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:50,950
Having scored an American #1 with
'Crazy Little Thing Called Love",

417
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:54,220
Queen received an offer
to play in South America,

418
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,965
a continent totally ignored
by the big rock bands.

419
00:27:58,225 --> 00:28:00,740
I remember they guy who
wanted to promote us,

420
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,913
he came over and said,
"Look, I tell you.

421
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:04,694
"You can play football
stadiums down here",

422
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:06,673
and we went, "Yeah, come on...

423
00:28:06,773 --> 00:28:08,532
Argentina, Brazil, they've
never heard of us. "

424
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:13,059
And he says, "No. I promise you you will
fill football stadiums everywhere you go."

425
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,201
Fred, how do you feel playing
and singing before 200,000 people?

426
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:18,525
I haven't done it yet.

427
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:23,872
# Another one bites the dust

428
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,400
The tour would take them
to Argentina and Brazil,

429
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,306
countries then under
military dictatorships.

430
00:28:30,406 --> 00:28:32,261
# Another one bites the dust

431
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,500
There was a great fear among
governments that

432
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,295
a large number of people gathered together
would be a dangerous force politically.

433
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:41,392
# How do you think
I'm going to get along

434
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:43,188
# Without you when you're gone

435
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:46,249
There was a sort of squad of military
in front of the stage,

436
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,395
a lot of rifles everywhere and

437
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:52,628
so we raised the English and
the Argentinean flags simultaneously

438
00:28:52,728 --> 00:28:54,372
each side of the stage.

439
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:07,163
In only a few years time, stadium rock
would align itself with political causes.

440
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:11,326
But for now, Freddy Mercury
had a more old fashioned idea

441
00:29:11,426 --> 00:29:13,345
of the role of the entertainer.

442
00:29:15,268 --> 00:29:16,958
He was completely apolitical.

443
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:21,197
And he was always insistent on the fact
that we had nothing to do with politics.

444
00:29:21,232 --> 00:29:26,967
We should stay out of it completely
and hopefully thereby above it.

445
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:33,437
By the time the tour
reached Brazil

446
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:36,879
they were playing to over
130,000 people.

447
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,117
Their stadium moment
had arrived

448
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:41,761
and the band connected
with their huge audiences

449
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:43,588
in a spectacular way.

450
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:46,289
# Hurry back hurry back,

451
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:49,472
# Don't take it away from me,

452
00:29:49,572 --> 00:29:56,328
# Because you don't know
what it means to me

453
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:02,645
That experience in Argentina
and Brazil echoes down now.

454
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:05,296
Generally if I meet someone
in the street

455
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:09,609
and they get very emotional and teary,
and want to put their arms around me,

456
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:11,329
usually it's an Argentinean

457
00:30:11,994 --> 00:30:13,820
or a Brazilian.

458
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,583
And I feel the same...
all that feeling comes back,

459
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:19,823
an amazing bond that we had
in South America at that time.

460
00:30:19,923 --> 00:30:22,444
# I want to break free

461
00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:26,496
# I want to break free

462
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:28,461
It was just as well
that Queen had built up

463
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:30,856
an enormous fan base in South America,

464
00:30:31,014 --> 00:30:34,501
in the US their career
would go into rapid decline.

465
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:37,326
Largely as a result of one
of their videos.

466
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:40,180
# I've got to break free

467
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:44,482
# God knows

468
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:49,245
# God knows I want to break free

469
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:52,589
I was out there at the time
doing some interviews

470
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:55,334
and I remember when you put
this video on people would go suddenly

471
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,548
blanche.

472
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:58,716
And go, "Well, we'll move swiftly on."

473
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:03,438
As if the fact that we dressed up
as girls and lampooned Coronation Street

474
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:04,922
they just didn't get the joke.

475
00:31:06,418 --> 00:31:09,858
A lot of America really wasn't
ready for that kind of thing.

476
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:12,576
And they dropped the record
like a stone.

477
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:16,754
# I don't want to live alone

478
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:20,600
Freddy did say, "Well, I don't
know about America.

479
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,391
"I suppose I'll have to fucking die
before we get to be there again."

480
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:25,237
And, you know...

481
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:28,765
not far off really.

482
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,726
As Queen discovered to their cost,

483
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:34,827
it was essential to understand
the American market.

484
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:38,956
And in the early 80s, few were better
at this than The Police.

485
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:44,028
In 1983, they delivered a record
that would take America by storm.

486
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:47,308
# Every breath you take

487
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,020
# Every move you make

488
00:31:52,322 --> 00:31:56,329
# Every bond you break,
every step you take

489
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,353
# I'll be watching you

490
00:31:58,378 --> 00:31:59,718
We all knew that it was a hit.

491
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,477
We all knew that
that was the best song

492
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:03,498
Sting had every written
up until that point.

493
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:08,421
He had a knack of writing a song
that ostensibly was about this,

494
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:12,210
but you listen closely to the lyrics
and really it's about that.

495
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,997
You know, it's a song about
voyeurism and stalking,

496
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:16,983
but it sounds like a love song.

497
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,423
# Oh, can't you see

498
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:24,286
# You belong to me

499
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:29,077
'Every Breath You Take' became
The Police's first American #1,

500
00:32:29,177 --> 00:32:31,571
and the band embarked
on a 9 month tour

501
00:32:31,671 --> 00:32:34,399
that saw them played
the most hallowed turf in rock,

502
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:40,438
Shea Stadium, where The Beatles
had performed to 56,000 people in 1965.

503
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:45,756
In 1983, The Police played
to over 70,000.

504
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:49,153
I remember walking out
introducing the group,

505
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:51,352
and I go, "Ladies and gentlemen.
And now..."

506
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:53,525
And the place erupted.

507
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:57,920
And I'm hearing this "Oahhhh!" from
the crowd, you could feel the wind of this.

508
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,757
And you're thinking, "Oh my God!"

509
00:32:59,857 --> 00:33:02,077
These guys are gonna
have that for 2 hours.

510
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,232
<i>This is called 'Synchronicity'.</i>

511
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:15,404
It is an incredible buzz.

512
00:33:15,504 --> 00:33:19,204
You just feel this very positive
energy coming towards you.

513
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:22,862
It's like... a wave.
You kind of absorb it.

514
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:24,845
It's very empowering.

515
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,668
It's a great experience.
It's a drug.

516
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:33,692
Shea Stadium sold out
within hours

517
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,497
and the show marked
the coronation of The Police

518
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,371
as the new kings
of stadium rock.

519
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:42,954
That's when we went
into the stratosphere.

520
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,142
At that point we're no longer the
cutting edge of the latest new thing.

521
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:48,391
We now own America.

522
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:15,766
The Police were now in a position
to enjoy the spoils of their victory.

523
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:22,056
# Giant steps are what you take
walking on the moon

524
00:34:22,156 --> 00:34:24,025
We would finish the last song

525
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:27,370
and three limousines are
right up against the stage.

526
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:33,132
And my limousine has my cold drinks,
my towels, everything I need,

527
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:39,221
'cause I come off soaking wet, I mean,
just heart pounding, head exploding.

528
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,446
The t-shirt salesmen, they're just
having money throwed at them.

529
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:49,227
10 dollar bills, 15... they make change,
and the money goes into a big trash bin.

530
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:53,585
They grab all those bags of loot
and throw them on the plane with us.

531
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:56,983
As it's taking off we can see
that whole part of the state

532
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:00,711
that's just jammed with cars trying
to get out of the stadium.

533
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:05,334
And we throw the bags like that and
it was just like Ebenezer Scrooge

534
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:06,444
swimming in his money,

535
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:09,857
I swear to God
it was a green blizzard in our plane.

536
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:12,321
The 'Synchronicity' world tour

537
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:17,104
saw the band play to millions of fans
at over a hundred shows.

538
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,610
We were a huge cash cow
while it was going,

539
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,487
so we're like the three treasures
protected inside a fortress.

540
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,403
I was saying to Stewart the other day,

541
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:29,900
it's like you sort of return to the
mind of a child, you become very simple.

542
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,639
Every move you make you're
sort of catered to it.

543
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,773
What's that over there?
Whatever it is they'll bring it here

544
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:37,095
so I can have a look at it.

545
00:35:37,295 --> 00:35:41,182
I want a... and there's
three guys going, "What?"

546
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:44,237
And I want a... string quartet.

547
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:48,063
And I began to feel that
I was loosing my ability to

548
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:51,169
be a human being in the human world.

549
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:54,440
There's only one way
to get out of there,

550
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,914
which was the meltdown
of the golden cage.

551
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:02,678
# In my life,
yeah, yeah,

552
00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:06,204
Sting was talking about possibly
to end the band.

553
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:12,093
I think at that point we were
so confused and glutted with it all

554
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:16,249
that we went "Oh, yeah, yeah.
Let's end it all."

555
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:17,427
What a great idea.

556
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:21,828
By the time the tour came
to an end in 1984,

557
00:36:21,928 --> 00:36:24,631
The Police had decided
to call it a day.

558
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:35,789
The Police peaked at a time
when the record industry was booming.

559
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:41,033
Gorged on multi-platinum records
by Michael Jackson, Prince, and others.

560
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:44,098
Every major artist would
have to work out

561
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:47,292
how to navigate this brave
new blockbuster world.

562
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:50,144
And Bruce Springsteen
was no different.

563
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:54,539
John Landau, his manager and producer,
was pushing him to really go out,

564
00:36:54,639 --> 00:37:01,199
and one time try to be
as far reaching, as successful,

565
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:04,440
as blockbuster as he could be.

566
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:14,646
The stadiums were beckoning Bruce.

567
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,778
But first, he needed a killer single
that would prepare the way.

568
00:37:20,435 --> 00:37:23,498
"Ok, what is the single?"
Well, you listen to the radio

569
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:26,215
and say, ok, that's what's going on

570
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:32,331
and you try, basically, to do your
version of what might fit in to that.

571
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:35,242
# I get up in the evening

572
00:37:35,357 --> 00:37:40,414
'Dancing in the Dark' was the lead single
for the new album 'Born in the USA'.

573
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:43,383
It had a rhythm track influenced
by Michael Jackson

574
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:47,419
and Bruce even consented to appear
in his first proper video.

575
00:37:47,596 --> 00:37:50,167
At last, Springsteen
was willing to see

576
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:52,405
just how far he could go.

577
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:58,333
# Hey there, baby
I could use just a little help

578
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:00,921
# You can't start a fire

579
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:04,921
# You can't start a fire
without a spark

580
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:07,519
# This gun's for hire

581
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:11,864
# Even if we're just
dancing in the dark

582
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:17,790
At that point I said, "Well, I'm here,
let me see what happens,

583
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,256
"let me see where it goes,
let me see what my limitations are."

584
00:38:21,314 --> 00:38:23,150
You know, you take the ride...

585
00:38:23,818 --> 00:38:26,978
I would have regretted terribly
if I felt like I had that opportunity

586
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:30,612
and hadn't made the most of it,
or hadn't taken it

587
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:33,827
to where I thought I could.

588
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:38,964
'Born in the USA' would become one of
the most successful records of the 1980s.

589
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:43,249
Its songs dominated the American
charts for nearly two years.

590
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:48,971
It had a ridiculous, ridiculous fate

591
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:53,677
of having seven top ten singles.

592
00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:58,074
To promote the album, Springsteen
embarked on a 15-month world tour

593
00:38:58,174 --> 00:39:01,111
*** him finally move up
to play stadiums.

594
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,926
The first day, one of the things we did*,
we were outside, in day time,

595
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:20,207
so you could see the massive
audience we had.

596
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:22,553
And that was kind of good fun.

597
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:26,197
# Born down in a dead man's town

598
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:29,008
# The first kick I took
was when I hit the ground

599
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:31,173
The title track, 'Born in the USA',

600
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:33,958
would be Springsteen's
most controversial song.

601
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:36,081
Behind the all American swagger

602
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:39,264
its lyrics spoke of darkness
and disillusion.

603
00:39:39,364 --> 00:39:42,472
# Born in the USA

604
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:46,082
# (I was) Born in the USA

605
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:48,447
In that song Bruce had encapsulated

606
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:51,801
the frustration, bitterness
and the disappointment

607
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:57,942
of so many of the people we'd met
who'd served in the Vietnam War.

608
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:03,773
# And so they put a rifle in my hands

609
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:07,842
# Sent me off to a foreign land

610
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:11,771
# To go and kill the yellow man

611
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:18,639
A lot of people misred the lyrics,
and Reagan was king at that point.

612
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:23,110
Everybody thought this was
a nationalistic pro-Reagan song,

613
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,232
that was good for 5-6
million probably, you know.

614
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:31,074
Amongst those who misinterpreted
the song was Reagan himself.

615
00:40:32,337 --> 00:40:36,622
America's future rests in a thousand
dreams inside your hearts.

616
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:39,775
If rests in the message of hope
in songs of a man

617
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:45,020
so many young Americans admire,
New Jersey's own Bruce Springsteen.

618
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,009
You gotta laugh.

619
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:55,546
You realise you clueless these people
that are in charge of things are.

620
00:40:55,885 --> 00:41:00,282
He doesn't know who Bruce Springsteen is,
I'm surprised he didn't say

621
00:41:00,382 --> 00:41:02,899
Bruce Springstine or
something, who knows?

622
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,819
I probably could've made a record
that would've been

623
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:09,733
more easily understood but
it wouldn't have been as good.

624
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:12,518
The record is right on the money.

625
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:15,533
There may be some misinterpretations
of it out there, you know,

626
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:17,934
but it was the right record.

627
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:24,231
'Born in the USA' would go on
to sell over 15 million copies in America.

628
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:29,161
President Reagan was not the only
person buying into the idea of Bruce,

629
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:32,209
the most ordinary mega-star
on the planet.

630
00:41:41,951 --> 00:41:45,920
Well, he's one of us.
He's part of New Jersey.

631
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,042
He loves Philadelphia,
he really does.

632
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:51,384
He's the boss, you know, we call him
'the boss' and he is the boss.

633
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:02,267
The people who really love
Springsteen, the real believers,

634
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:07,732
they think that when Springsteen
is not in the studio or on tour,

635
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:11,053
he actually goes back to New Jersey
and works in a car wash.

636
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,551
So he becomes this idea,
this impossible idea

637
00:42:14,651 --> 00:42:17,412
that makes him messianic.

638
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:28,730
He wasn't putting on
an act or anything,

639
00:42:29,378 --> 00:42:32,341
he really was a kind
of regular guy.

640
00:42:32,903 --> 00:42:35,440
And the fact that he was
commercially successful

641
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:40,839
was simply a matter of greatness
as far as I'm concerned.

642
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:42,433
That's it.

643
00:42:45,685 --> 00:42:48,525
For all of 'Born in the USA's
huge success

644
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:51,418
in the overheated rock industry
of the 1980s

645
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:54,327
other artist's albums
were selling even more.

646
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,633
The numbers were vast.

647
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:58,500
And even Dire Straits,

648
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,487
fronted by unassuming Geordie
Mark Knopfler,

649
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:05,721
suddenly discovered they were one of
the most popular groups in the world.

650
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:08,311
# ... and alarm

651
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:13,873
# You did not desert me

652
00:43:13,973 --> 00:43:17,764
# My brothers in arms

653
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,398
I love the fact that any stuff
that I may have done

654
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:27,557
has influenced so many
kids around the world,

655
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,952
because it just happened
to be in front of them.

656
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:32,792
It's not because it was
good or anything

657
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:34,967
it was just because it was
in front of them.

658
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:36,772
And that's what happens.

659
00:43:36,872 --> 00:43:40,267
And you just take your little place
in the chain.

660
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:48,354
# I want my MTV

661
00:43:48,421 --> 00:43:51,721
Dire Straits' 1985 album
'Brothers in Arms'

662
00:43:51,821 --> 00:43:54,107
would sell over 30 million copies.

663
00:43:54,323 --> 00:43:57,285
In large part this was thanks
to a monster single,

664
00:43:57,395 --> 00:44:00,289
the unforgettable
'Money for Nothing'.

665
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:15,686
That's the secret
of the whole thing.

666
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,609
It's just to do with
the picking.

667
00:44:31,612 --> 00:44:34,619
# Now look at them yo-yos
that's the way you do it

668
00:44:35,228 --> 00:44:38,653
# You play the guitar on the MTV

669
00:44:38,814 --> 00:44:41,982
# That ain't workin'
that's the way you do it

670
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:45,191
# Money for nothin' and
the chicks for free

671
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:49,021
'Money for Nothing' was a wry
commentary on the slick world of MTV

672
00:44:49,121 --> 00:44:50,779
and the 80s music industry.

673
00:44:52,783 --> 00:44:56,170
But with the song's success,
Mark Knopfler soon took his place

674
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,340
in the world he was satirizing.

675
00:45:01,054 --> 00:45:04,717
Everybody wanted to see us.
Everybody wanted to have the records.

676
00:45:04,817 --> 00:45:06,982
You reach a kind of critical mass.

677
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,446
It is not a normal existence.

678
00:45:10,546 --> 00:45:15,107
There were certainly periods
where I'd be probably drinking too much,

679
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:20,155
probably having my personality
smacked about a bit

680
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,976
by the size of events.

681
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:27,554
The 'Brothers in Arms' tour
saw Dire Straits play 248 shows

682
00:45:27,654 --> 00:45:30,301
in 117 different cities.

683
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:34,092
They packed out Wembley Arena
for 13 nights.

684
00:45:34,495 --> 00:45:37,245
# Here comes Johnny
singing oldies, goldies

685
00:45:37,378 --> 00:45:39,495
# Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say

686
00:45:39,761 --> 00:45:42,082
# Here comes Johnny
singing I Gotta Woman

687
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:44,805
# Down in the tunnels,
trying to make it pay

688
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:47,722
# He got the action, he got the motion

689
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:50,153
# Oh Yeah the boy can play

690
00:45:50,396 --> 00:45:52,717
# Dedication devotion

691
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:55,248
# Turning all the night time
into the day

692
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,463
# He do the song about
the sweet lovin' woman

693
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:59,699
# He do the song about the knife

694
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:06,312
# He do the walk, he do the walk of life,
yeah he do the walk of life

695
00:46:07,052 --> 00:46:08,527
The sheer scale of the success

696
00:46:08,627 --> 00:46:12,518
enjoyed by Dire Straits and others
at the height of the 80s music boom

697
00:46:12,618 --> 00:46:14,673
would have an important consequence.

698
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:21,767
The market for rock music
had a huge booming from the mid 80s.

699
00:46:21,867 --> 00:46:26,297
Loads of people benefited from that,
lots of artists benefited from that,

700
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:29,612
and you could say a degree
of guilt came with that.

701
00:46:29,712 --> 00:46:35,008
A sense of, we have this popularity,
we have this audience, this platform.

702
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:39,986
Is all we're going to do with it
just sell more records and tickets,

703
00:46:40,086 --> 00:46:43,082
or can we, should we do
something more?

704
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,380
<i>'Money for nothing
and chicks for free',</i>

705
00:46:46,522 --> 00:46:48,546
<i>that's the chorus of one
of their songs.</i>

706
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:51,690
<i>But their hearts are in helping
to feed those who are starving...</i>

707
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,709
<i>and making great music.</i>

708
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:56,959
<i>From London, Dire Straits!</i>

709
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,316
On July 13th, 1985,

710
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:03,362
Dire Straits were in the middle
of their run at Wembley Arena,

711
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:07,616
but took time out to play a charity show
over in Wembley Stadium,

712
00:47:07,716 --> 00:47:11,567
that would be seen on TV
by a third of the world's population.

713
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:15,946
We just turned up to do
the gig as normal.

714
00:47:16,046 --> 00:47:18,628
We walked across the car park
to do 'Live Aid',

715
00:47:18,828 --> 00:47:22,752
but somebody said, there's 700 million
people watching or something,

716
00:47:22,787 --> 00:47:26,298
and you just think to yourself,
"Wow! I hope I don't mess up. "

717
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,230
Dire Straits did far from mess up.

718
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,222
They took to the stage with Sting

719
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:38,845
who sang the intro to 'Money for Nothing'
as he had on the record.

720
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:49,988
# I want my, I want my MTV

721
00:47:52,171 --> 00:47:55,361
'Live Aid' marked the moment
when the biggest names in rock

722
00:47:55,461 --> 00:47:59,723
realised the could mobilise
a global audience in a call to action.

723
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:05,308
What music does,
it's still the Pied Piper.

724
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,160
The Pied Piper didn't get the rats
out of the sewers,

725
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,043
or whatever he did lead
them to the thing,

726
00:48:11,078 --> 00:48:12,958
it was the music which drew them

727
00:48:13,174 --> 00:48:14,931
to the river to be drowned.

728
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:19,464
And so rock 'n roll was
globalisation's Pied Piper

729
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,422
and it summoned people
to the electronic hearth,

730
00:48:23,096 --> 00:48:25,844
this was the world's fireplace now,
the television.

731
00:48:30,097 --> 00:48:33,345
Queen were one group Bob Geldof
wanted on board,

732
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:37,676
but the band's Roger Taylor had warned
him that Freddy Mercury would be reluctant

733
00:48:37,776 --> 00:48:40,362
to mix music and politics.

734
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:46,943
Rog said to me that
Fred won't want to do it,

735
00:48:47,043 --> 00:48:50,061
so I didn't sell it
as a political thing to Queen.

736
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:55,561
I said, "Fred, of any band in
all the world, of any artist,

737
00:48:55,661 --> 00:49:00,179
"you were born for this stage.
You. Darling of the world!"

738
00:49:00,216 --> 00:49:02,035
# Buddy you're a boy make a big noise

739
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:05,015
# Playin' in the street gonna be
a big man some day

740
00:49:05,115 --> 00:49:06,282
# You got mud on yo' face

741
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:07,639
# You big disgrace

742
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:09,807
# Kickin' your can all over the place

743
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:14,112
- Sing it!
# We will we will rock you

744
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:19,119
# All we hear is Radio ga ga

745
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:20,937
# Radio goo goo

746
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:22,874
# Radio ga ga

747
00:49:22,912 --> 00:49:24,128
We just put our heads down

748
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:27,254
played hard and let Freddy
strut his stuff.

749
00:49:27,647 --> 00:49:33,037
He just managed to dominate,
seize the... Wembley,

750
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:35,469
and take it over and conduct.

751
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:41,537
# Someone still loves you!

752
00:49:47,573 --> 00:49:49,947
I don't know if it was just me,
but I thought Queen,

753
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:55,465
and this is your old pub-punk-rocker,
I thought Queen were amazing.

754
00:49:57,773 --> 00:50:01,831
And I think that's when
they specifically marked their stamp

755
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:05,643
as one of the greatest
rock 'n roll bands in their own right.

756
00:50:05,743 --> 00:50:11,332
# We are the champions

757
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:19,273
# Of the world

758
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:27,302
'Live Aid' would also be
an important watershed for U2,

759
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:32,095
the last great band to emerge
from stadium rock's golden age.

760
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:37,055
# It puts my back up,
puts my back up against the wall

761
00:50:37,598 --> 00:50:41,345
# Sunday, Bloody Sunday

762
00:50:41,947 --> 00:50:44,894
# Sunday, Bloody Sunday

763
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:46,438
During their second number,

764
00:50:46,538 --> 00:50:50,731
lead singer Bono would make his mark
with a gesture of high drama.

765
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:58,299
Bono, in his need to reach out
and touch the audience

766
00:50:58,399 --> 00:51:01,095
which he'd been doing
in smaller venues and in theaters.

767
00:51:01,195 --> 00:51:03,493
You know, he'd always go
running off to do...

768
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,062
this thing that he used to do,
which was to drag somebody up and dance.

769
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:08,079
Springsteen used to do
the same thing as well.

770
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:10,156
Probably a trick that he'd picked up
from Springsteen.

771
00:51:10,256 --> 00:51:12,903
He decided to do that
at Wembley Stadium...

772
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:23,067
It took several minutes,

773
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:27,438
but Bono ended up with a ten-second
clinch surrounded by photographers.

774
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:31,648
The images of his embrace
were seen all around the world.

775
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:35,830
Bono had provided
the perfect TV moment,

776
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,669
and that was a TV event.

777
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:39,820
It wasn't an ordinary live concert.

778
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,952
All their albums were back
into the charts.

779
00:51:42,137 --> 00:51:46,841
And that led on to 'The Joshua Tree',
the biggest album of their career,

780
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:49,819
and the moment when they became
the biggest band in the world.

781
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,093
If 'Live Aid' had given stadium rock
a conscience,

782
00:52:07,193 --> 00:52:11,501
with 'The Joshua Tree' U2 would
be the ones who would keep it alive.

783
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,074
Behind the album's iconic imagery

784
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:17,721
they along held belief
in music with a message.

785
00:52:18,716 --> 00:52:25,091
The total package together
spoke of something serious and austere.

786
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:26,747
And kind of heavy.

787
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:29,410
# And I can see those fighter planes

788
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:32,214
# I can see those fighter planes

789
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,185
# Across the mud huts where
the children sleep

790
00:52:35,561 --> 00:52:38,415
# Through the alleys of
a quiet city street

791
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,994
# You take the staircase
to the first floor

792
00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:45,081
At the heart of 'The Joshua Tree'
was the song 'Bullet the Blue Sky',

793
00:52:45,181 --> 00:52:47,744
a direct response to the Reagan
Administration's

794
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:50,647
covert military operations
in Central America.

795
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:52,850
# Outside is America

796
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:55,586
# Outside is America

797
00:53:02,706 --> 00:53:06,861
U2's outspokenness made the media
sit up and take notice.

798
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:11,279
But for many stadium rock bands
the music was the message.

799
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,017
The bands that were emerging
in the 80s, apart from U2,

800
00:53:17,117 --> 00:53:19,800
seemed almost like designer
stadium bands.

801
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:25,902
Bon Jovi take the formula of Bruce
Springsteen and reduce it to a pop rock.

802
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:29,776
They lead into to Guns 'n Roses,
it's just all empty bombast.

803
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:35,553
Big had become sort of synonymous
with something bland,

804
00:53:35,653 --> 00:53:40,459
and so probably U2 felt it tainting
them through their seriousness,

805
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,238
their perceived seriousness.

806
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:44,824
As the 80s became the 90s,

807
00:53:44,924 --> 00:53:47,980
U2 decided it was time
to lighten up their image.

808
00:53:48,756 --> 00:53:53,470
When they came to tour their
futuristic 1991 album, 'Achtung Baby',

809
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,751
the band entrusted lighting
designer, Willie Williams,

810
00:53:56,851 --> 00:54:01,844
with the task of dreaming up the most
elaborate stadium rock show yet seen,

811
00:54:02,153 --> 00:54:03,680
'Zoo TV'.

812
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,144
It became clear that where
we were going had to be

813
00:54:14,605 --> 00:54:16,988
something on a scale that
hadn't been seen before.

814
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:21,394
And I was really pushing for
a video art installation on stage

815
00:54:21,494 --> 00:54:22,989
in which they could perform.

816
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:47,796
What they put together was

817
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:50,836
the most extravagant
multi-media experience.

818
00:54:51,628 --> 00:54:55,940
It felt like an absolute
technological 'splend'.

819
00:55:11,055 --> 00:55:15,038
Zoo TV used its video screens
as the focus of the show

820
00:55:15,138 --> 00:55:18,230
that was a dark celebration
of the modern world.

821
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,433
Let's see what we've got on TV.

822
00:55:21,003 --> 00:55:23,860
The stage set projected
films and slogans

823
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,503
and could even pick up
local TV stations.

824
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:28,941
What is this?
Soap operas?

825
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:34,739
Behind Zoo TV sensory overload

826
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:38,868
was a belief that stadium rock
could do more than merely entertain.

827
00:55:38,888 --> 00:55:43,456
It could challenge, provoke or change
the way an audience looked at the world.

828
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,865
U2 are artists with a mission.

829
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:52,509
To them a mass audience is a repository
of potential for good.

830
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:56,354
And a great artist can reach
into that audience

831
00:55:56,454 --> 00:56:01,287
and can pull out something better,
if you like,

832
00:56:01,387 --> 00:56:04,217
artistically and morally.

833
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:09,049
The band would even conduct live
satellite links with their own reporter

834
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:12,061
in the then besieged city
of Sarajevo.

835
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:17,946
There's about 10 to 15 thousand
refugees that are being

836
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:23,222
attacked by artillery
and they have nowhere to go.

837
00:56:31,092 --> 00:56:33,641
But music remained the core
of the show.

838
00:56:33,846 --> 00:56:35,729
After an audiovisual assault,

839
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:39,033
U2 introduced something
new in stadium rock,

840
00:56:39,244 --> 00:56:42,803
the B-Stage, where they performed
an intimate set,

841
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:45,091
totally surrounded
by the audience.

842
00:56:46,018 --> 00:56:48,039
# It was a cold and wet December day

843
00:56:48,545 --> 00:56:50,769
# When we touched the ground at JFK

844
00:56:50,947 --> 00:56:53,181
# Snow was melting on the ground

845
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:55,459
# On BLS I heard the sound

846
00:56:55,655 --> 00:56:57,939
# Of an angel

847
00:57:00,477 --> 00:57:02,717
# New York, like a Christmas tree

848
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:05,207
# Tonight this city belongs to me

849
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:08,171
# Angel

850
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:16,950
With Zoo TV, U2 had created
the ultimate stadium rock show.

851
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,142
U2 were the only act that
I can remember seeing

852
00:57:22,242 --> 00:57:24,730
who really were great
in a football stadium.

853
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,325
You go to see the Stones
and they do it,

854
00:57:26,425 --> 00:57:27,972
but you'd much rather see
them in an arena,

855
00:57:28,072 --> 00:57:30,333
you'd much rather see them
in Madison Square Garden

856
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:32,346
than see them at Giants Stadium.

857
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:36,982
U2 actually made the stadium work.

858
00:57:46,551 --> 00:57:49,068
U2 are the best stadium rock band
that's ever been.

859
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:51,586
It doesn't mean they're
the best rock band's ever been,

860
00:57:51,686 --> 00:57:55,579
but they have the ambition
to fill those spaces with something...

861
00:57:56,081 --> 00:58:00,608
truly remarkable and new
and challenging.

862
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:05,063
Everybody who saw Zoo knows
they'll never see the likes of that again.

863
