1
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,213
Νέα Υόρκη, 1975,

2
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:37,441
μια πόλη κοντά στην χρεωκοπία
και ένα μέρος καθόλου διασκεδαστικό.

3
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,614
Λονδίνο, 1975,

4
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:45,514
όχι καλύτερα.

5
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:47,976
Και οι δύο πόλεις
είχαν χάσει τον δρόμο τους,

6
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:50,371
και για μια ομάδα
νεαρών μουσικών και φανς,

7
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:51,411
το ίδιο είχε γίνει και με το ροκ.

8
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,972
Και στις δύο πλευρές του Ατλαντικού,
ήθελαν να ξανασυνδεθούν

9
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:56,812
με το αληθινό πνεύμα του ροκ.

10
00:00:57,772 --> 00:01:01,518
Την σκληρότητα, την πλήρη ωμότητα.
Την απλότητα του πράγματος.

11
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:03,306
Το να μην χάνεις την ώρα σου, ξέρεις.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,473
Έτσι, για μια σύντομη περίοδο, 
παίχτηκε μουσική με πάθος και οργή.

13
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:12,094
"Πανκ"

14
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:15,707
Το πανκ ήταν μια συζήτηση
μεταξύ δύο πόλεων.

15
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,623
Το Λονδίνο έμαθε από την στάση και το
στυλ Νεο-Υορκέζων όπως η Patti Smith,

16
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:24,509
και εμπνεύστηκε από τον μινιμαλιστικό
ήχο των Ramones.

17
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:27,392
Όταν άκουσα το πρώτο άλμπουμ
των Ramones

18
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:31,485
ήταν σαν να έβαλα το δάχτυλο στην πρίζα.

19
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:32,728
Ήταν... Αααα!

20
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:35,630
Αλλά οι μπάντες του Λονδίνου
όπως οι Sex Pistols και οι Clash,

21
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,137
έφτιαξαν μετά ένα πανκ ροκ
που ήταν μοναδικά Βρετανικό.

22
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,720
Τραγουδούσαν με τις Λονδρέζικες
"cockney" φωνές τους,

23
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,710
για πράγματα που γνώριζαν
με τη γλώσσα του δρόμου.

24
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,090
Και ήταν αληθινό και τίμιο
και παθιασμένο.

25
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:53,407
Οι Sex Pistols ήταν αλαζόνες και χλεύαζαν,
σε συνδυασμό με μια μουσική

26
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:56,317
γεμάτη σύγκρουση και θυμό.

27
00:01:57,225 --> 00:02:01,278
Δεν προσποιούμαστε,
ούτε το παίζουμε "υπεράνω".

28
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:04,948
Υποφέρουμε και γι' αυτό άντε γαμ..τε!

29
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:08,806
Το κοινό και με τις δύο πόλεις
ήταν η επιθυμία

30
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:11,333
να γίνει το πανκ η μουσική
που μπορούσες να ελέγξεις,

31
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:14,479
που μπορούσες να είσαι ο εαυτός σου
κάνοντάς το ο ίδιος.

32
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:17,684
Σκεφτόσουν οτι όλα παίζουν.

33
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:20,399
Η πόρτα ήταν ανοιχτή για να
κάνεις ό,τι ήθελες.

34
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,803
Αν είχες μια ιδέα, μπορούσες
να την πραγματοποιήσεις.

35
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,456
Ηταν σαν να βάλαμε
το κλειδί στη πόρτα.

36
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:27,450
Σε αυτή την ιστορία δύο πόλεων,

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,809
από τις χειρότερες στιγμές
βγήκαν οι καλύτερες στιγμές,

38
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:32,957
και η Τρίτη Εποχή του Ροκ.

39
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:37,418
Προσπαθώ πολύ να είμαι καλός.

40
00:02:57,256 --> 00:03:00,636
Το καλοκαίρι του 1974,
τέσσερις "απροσάρμοστοι" από το Queens

41
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,431
άρχισαν να παίζουν σε ένα νέο κλαμπ
στο Lower East Side της Νέας Υόρκης.

42
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:11,059
Το κλαμπ λεγόταν CBGBs
και το συγκρότημα ήταν οι Ramones.

43
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:20,939
# I don't wanna walk around with you

44
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,085
Την πρώτη φορά που είδα
τους Ramones να παίζουν

45
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:25,509
νομίζω έπαιξαν 16 τραγούδια
σε 12 λεπτά,

46
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,656
ή ίσως ήταν 12 τραγούδια
σε 16 λεπτά.

47
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:33,469
Δεν θέλαμε να βαρεθεί το κοινό.

48
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:36,732
Θέλαμε να βγούμε, να παίξουμε
και να φύγουμε...

49
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,931
Οι άνθρωποι έχουν τη ζωή τους, ξέρεις.

50
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:44,052
Δεν θέλουμε να σπαταλάμε τον χρόνο τους,
θέλουμε μόνο να παίξουμε τα δικά μας...

51
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:45,485
και να τελειώνουμε.

52
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:47,796
# I don't wanna walk around with you

53
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:49,885
# I don't wanna walk around with you

54
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:52,198
# I don't wanna walk around with you

55
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,993
# I don't wanna walk around with you

56
00:03:55,733 --> 00:04:00,383
Ηταν τόσο αστείο αλλά και έξυπνο,
τόσο τρελά αποφασιστικό,

57
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:03,768
και τόσο σοβαρό και έντονο,
ξέρεις, ήταν πράγματι...

58
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,766
ήταν σπουδαίοι.

59
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:08,012
Πάντα ήταν, δηλαδή,
τους αγάπησα από την πρώτη στιγμή.

60
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:11,665
Εκείνα τα τρελά γρήγορα τέμπο,

61
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,379
η ματιά, ο ήχος, η στάση,

62
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,245
χωρίς τους Ramones, αυτό το πρόγραμμα
μάλλον δεν θα υπήρχε.

63
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:20,461
Είμαστε οι Ramones,

64
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,344
και "είσαι ένα φωνακλάδικό μωρό,
καλύτερα να σκάσεις".

65
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:29,203
Οι Ramones ήταν περήφανοι που
ήταν άγριοι και έτοιμοι.

66
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:33,138
Και αυτό ήλπιζα πάντα,
όταν τα παιδιά δουν τους Ramones

67
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:35,957
να πιστέψουν οτι μπορούν να βγουν
και να κάνουν το ίδιο.

68
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:37,880
Αυτό υποτίθεται οτι ήταν το ροκ εν ρολ.

69
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:43,343
Στα τέλη των 60s τα πράγματα ξέφυγαν,
πολλοί άρχισαν να εντρυφούν σε μακριά...

70
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:49,480
σόλο και... έβλεπες κάποιον
σαν τον Jeff Beck ή τον Jimmy Hendrix

71
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,230
και ένοιωθες οτι έπρεπε να εξασκηθείς για
20 χρόνια για να μπορείς να παίξεις αυτό το κομμάτι.

72
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:55,908
Ο ήχος που εβγαινε από
την κιθάρα του Johnny Ramone,

73
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,283
καθόρισε το συγκρότημα.

74
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:00,641
Το θέμα με τον Johnny ήταν πως...

75
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:05,202
αφού δεν στόχευε στην
συνηθισμένη δεξιοτεχνία,

76
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:11,565
δημιούργησε την δική του δεξιοτεχνία
χτυπώντας τις χορδές πολύ γρήγορα.

77
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:15,810
Τα τραγούδια ήταν ακατέργαστα,
χωρίς σόλο, μόνο συγχορδίες,

78
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,118
αλλά ταυτόχρονα τόσο πιασάρικα.

79
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:22,589
Αλλά οι στίχοι ήταν τόσο τρελοί,
παιδί του δρόμου στο Queens,

80
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,640
σχετικά με σνιφάρισμα κόλας και
καυγάδες με ρόπαλα του μπέϊζμπολ.

81
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,925
Ηταν απίθανο, το γούσταρα.

82
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:31,303
# Now I wanna sniff some glue

83
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:34,261
# Now I wanna have somethin to do

84
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:36,732
# All the kids wanna sniff some glue

85
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:39,457
# All the kids want somethin to do

86
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:43,298
We wrote about things
that affected us, you know, directly.

87
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:48,880
Songs were like a release
for our frustration and...

88
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,574
getting out our aggression and uh...

89
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:58,125
Songs dealt with feelings of alienation
and isolation and all kinds of...

90
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,662
just feelings, you know.

91
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:08,517
Everything sort of happened
without any really uh...

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,210
conscious effort.

93
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:15,057
We just fell into our style
as we went along.

94
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:20,653
We wanted at first to... we thought
we were playing bubblegum music.

95
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,336
Sort of like a sick bubblegum music,

96
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:26,525
which became punk.

97
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,331
A year later, in London,

98
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:37,666
another group of rock outsiders
began their own campaign

99
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:40,273
to rip it up and start again.

100
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:45,589
The Sex Pistols formed
on the King's Road, Chelsea,

101
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:49,397
when a boy named John was seen
wearing an unusual T-shirt.

102
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:52,816
It was 'cause I had an
'I hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on,

103
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,721
you know, for a laugh.

104
00:06:55,605 --> 00:06:59,195
I didn't have many clothes
but I did have a Pink Floyd t-shirt

105
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:00,845
and I just wrote "I hate" on it.

106
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:03,274
And look, it launched a career.

107
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:07,242
Is that luck? What is that?

108
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:11,217
At "Sex", the fetish shop
of one Malcolm McLaren,

109
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,295
an unusual audition took place.

110
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:17,676
The boy from Finsbury Park
mimed to the shop's juke box.

111
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,348
They did have an Alice Cooper song
called 'I'm Eighteen' which I did know

112
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:25,317
'cause I liked Alice Cooper.

113
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,482
It was that fine man.

114
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:31,338
Nobody wore a corset quite like him.

115
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:34,328
# I'll go runnin in outer space

116
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,109
The other boys in the band
looked at Johnny

117
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:39,824
and knew straight away that there was...
something about him.

118
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:43,250
It was an odd scenario, I mean,

119
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:48,415
miming to somebody else's record
to these blokes you've hardly met.

120
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,026
And he was embarrassed,

121
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:57,483
but he put on this kind of weird...
front, which was interesting.

122
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,641
He couldn't sing for a toffee,
but there was something about him.

123
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,319
# I get confused every day

124
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,960
# Eighteen I just don't know...

125
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,251
I couldn't sing a note,
never ever tried.

126
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:11,549
But I liked it.

127
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:15,818
I grabbed it by the testicles
and ran with it, from thereon in.

128
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,406
I know... hence
the squealing high tones.

129
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:24,144
The Sex Pistols found themselves
a rehearsal place up West,

130
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:25,910
Denmark Street, Soho.

131
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,828
Tin Pan Alley, historic home
to London's finest pop hustles.

132
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:34,448
We had a base, you know,
we could leave our gear set up,

133
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:37,292
we had somewhere to hang out,
somewhere to practice.

134
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,364
And we did... we were there
practically every day.

135
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,656
We could hear nothing because
of the horrible noises we made,

136
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,389
but maybe that was kind of good.

137
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:49,066
<i>Do we know any other fucking
songs that we could do?</i>

138
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:53,501
Here they learnt how to play

139
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,551
by covering 'mod' classics like
'Substitute' by The Who.

140
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:07,063
# You think we look
pretty good together

141
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:13,939
# You think my shoes
are made of leather

142
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,650
Into 1976, the Pistols
had begun to perform live

143
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,702
attracting a growing reputation
with their chaotic performances

144
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:25,678
and unlikely venues,
like the '100 Club', on Oxford Street.

145
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:31,174
The Pistols were not really
like a typical performance,

146
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:35,333
or a typical concert where you pay
your money, you go, you're entertained.

147
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:40,212
It was more like some sort of spontaneous
confrontational art happening.

148
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:46,821
Get out! Get out!

149
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:50,180
Fucking ol' hippies!

150
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,381
You learn your chops on stage,
you know, you do.

151
00:09:54,581 --> 00:09:56,721
You learn all your stage movements

152
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:59,298
away from where
the bottles are coming from.

153
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:04,100
And there was an awful lot of that.
People hated us.

154
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:13,136
# If you could see...
oh God, fuck off...

155
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:18,215
# Ayanlouisiannayaya New Orleans

156
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:21,000
But for the Sex Pistols to be
more than a covers band,

157
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,995
they needed to write
their own songs.

158
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:23,991
# ...Johnny B. Goode

159
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,565
# Agogogogogogo Johnny B. Goode

160
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:30,233
# Agogo, go Johnny, gogogogogo

161
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:34,824
To find the first flashes of inspiration,
the Pistols' manager, Malcolm McLaren,

162
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:39,130
persuaded them to look at a band
he'd recently met in New York.

163
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:44,452
This was 'Television', formed
by Richard Hell and Tom Verlaine.

164
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:53,224
Television were painfully serious
about making music as provocation.

165
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:59,641
It had to do with aggressively
not looking to please the audience.

166
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:04,592
Playing songs that are
kind of psychotic...

167
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:08,568
The way the world felt.

168
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:14,947
But also lyrical, but really loud
and physical.

169
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,814
And everything ragged but...

170
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:20,593
intense.

171
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,170
# Now Little Johnny Jewel

172
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:29,999
But equally important is the art
punk intensity of the music,

173
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:33,460
Richard Hell had a clearly
thought out image for the band,

174
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,431
and this impressed McLaren.

175
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:40,344
Malcolm saw Richard with
his chopped up clothes

176
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:45,449
and his hacked off hair
and his gorgeous sunglasses.

177
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:49,526
And thought this is
the look of the future,

178
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:51,963
this what rock 'n roll
is gonna look like.

179
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:57,905
McLaren was also struck by the
nihilistic message of a song Hell wrote

180
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,369
called 'Blank Generation'.

181
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:07,666
I did think it would be interesting
and fun to try to distinguish

182
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:15,677
the way things look like to me
from hippies or beatnicks or whatever.

183
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:24,875
This next number's called
'I belong to the blank generation'.

184
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:38,823
'I was sayin' let me out
of here before I was even born.'

185
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:41,212
'It's such a gamble
when you get a face.'

186
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:44,539
'It's fascinatin' to observe
what the mirror does but when I dine'

187
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,905
'it's for the wall that I set a place.'

188
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,060
# But when I dine it's for
the wall that I set a place

189
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,646
# I belong to the blank generation and

190
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:56,591
# I can take it or leave it each time

191
00:12:56,691 --> 00:13:01,221
# I belong to the ______ generation but

192
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:04,185
# I can take it or leave it each time

193
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:16,336
'Triangles were fallin at the window
as the doctor cursed.'

194
00:13:16,436 --> 00:13:20,093
'He was a cartoon long
forsaken by the public eye.'

195
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:23,398
'The nurse adjusted her garters
as I breathed my first.'

196
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:27,526
'The doctor grabbed my throat and yelled,
"God's consolation prize!"'

197
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:30,626
# I belong to the blank generation and

198
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,492
# I can take it or leave it each time

199
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:38,630
# I belong to the ______ generation but

200
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,306
# I can take it or leave it each time

201
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:47,602
It avoids clarifying 'blank', you know,

202
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,139
'cause that's the whole point.

203
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:54,119
It's empty, it's blank, it's uh...

204
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,559
It's up to you to make it up.

205
00:13:57,424 --> 00:14:01,463
Back in London, the Pistols took Hell's
idea of a blank generation

206
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:04,132
but now put it
in a very British context,

207
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:07,807
where not just a city, but a whole
country seemed in crisis.

208
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:10,283
There was this raw air of desperation.

209
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:13,644
There was practically a hung parliament,

210
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:17,655
there were power cuts, there was
rubbish piled up on the streets.

211
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:20,996
And.. you know, the three day week.

212
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:23,073
I mean, there was just
a real feeling of despondency,

213
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:26,477
and I saw this blank generation idea
and I thought, "Yeah, you know,

214
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:29,128
"I could use it somehow", and came up
with this 'Pretty Vacant' idea.

215
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:32,469
As for nailing the riffs,
base player Glen Matlock

216
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:36,835
playfully dipped into a very un-punky,
not very arty, influence,

217
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:38,030
ABBA.

218
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,696
In one of their songs
there's a bit in it,

219
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:41,462
and it doesn't have that riff in it...

220
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:43,301
but it has a thing it goes...

221
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:50,348
And you can hardly hear it,
but it just set me thinking.

222
00:14:56,533 --> 00:15:01,029
# Where are those happy days,
they seem so hard to find

223
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:04,549
The most moronic riff
you can get is...

224
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:09,159
but... kind of there, it's just not--
it's the same note.

225
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,370
So I'm fooling around,
you know, what is it?

226
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,133
Off... I've got a riff. It's the most
straightforward, moronic,

227
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:27,499
dadaist kind of riff
to go with this idea.

228
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:29,851
'Pretty Vacant'.

229
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:41,256
It was one of the very first
Pistols' songs and dealing with...

230
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:44,807
something other than what
your normal pop group will do.

231
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:47,666
Something kind of a bit of a...
manifesto somehow.

232
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:51,244
You know, our mission statement.

233
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:54,494
# There's no point in asking
us you'll get no reply

234
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:57,947
# Oh just remember a don't decide

235
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:01,213
# I got no reason it's all too much

236
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:04,403
# You'll always find us

237
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:07,745
# Out to lunch!

238
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:11,187
# Oh, we're so pretty

239
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:15,956
# Oh so pretty vacant

240
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:17,979
# Oh, we're so pretty...

241
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:19,302
With 'Pretty Vacant',

242
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:22,028
the Sex Pistols weren't just talking
about their generation

243
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:23,204
but to them.

244
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:25,447
They began to change lives.

245
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:30,218
As someone the same age,
you'd got what he was saying.

246
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,742
You didn't feel like, "Ooh, he's scary,

247
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,574
"shouting at me,
he's telling me to fuck off."

248
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:36,044
No, you understood that he was saying,

249
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:37,837
"Get off your arses. Do something.

250
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,211
"I'm not doing it the same way
everyone's done it before,

251
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:41,960
"and like it or piss off."

252
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:47,985
It was so new that you realised
you'd have to go home and start...

253
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:52,515
shedding quite a lot of the bands
you took around with you.

254
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:56,671
It was like being re-programmed.

255
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:10,693
Seeing the Sex Pistols was the spark
that brought together another punk band,

256
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:12,015
The Clash.

257
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,597
Their singer, Joe Strummer,

258
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:16,631
saw the light after the Pistols
were support to his old band,

259
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,811
pub rockers, 'The 101ers'.

260
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:23,108
I remember the Pistols' show was uh...

261
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:27,535
curtailed suddenly by a fist fire,

262
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:32,362
that actually spread from the stage.

263
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,947
And we all saw this, and it was like...
it kind of outshadowed, in a way,

264
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:43,533
Joe's performance afterwards,
so it was like the old and the new,

265
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:45,097
singing in the same place.

266
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,430
And I know it was
a marking point for Joe.

267
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,562
He went like, "This is the new thing
it's coming now. I can see that."

268
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:54,430
You can't change
the way that things are going.

269
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,980
And he said, "I'm gonna get on...
get with this.", you know,

270
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,939
the new thing that was coming in.

271
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,445
By 1976, there was another
influence from New York,

272
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:14,720
this was a singer who made it very clear
that anything might now be possible,

273
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,556
if you had the passion.

274
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:19,380
This was Patti Smith.

275
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:24,649
She was one of this very
strong poet performers.

276
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:30,567
And with a razor-sharp mouth
that would deliver.

277
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:36,945
# Wild card up my sleeve

278
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,048
Visceral...

279
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:43,315
It was about language, just language.

280
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,902
Never mind what the music's doing,
the music's doing fine,

281
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:49,864
but the language is spitting out
something that goes right into your head.

282
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,921
It was very good.

283
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:59,525
# I-I walk in a room

284
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,730
# you know I look so proud

285
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:11,958
# I'm movin' in this here atmosphere...

286
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,467
The Patti Smith band fused
performance poetry with 3-chord rock.

287
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:20,672
They took the 60s garage band classic,
'Gloria', added a little wrapping,

288
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:22,729
and then punked it up.

289
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:27,042
It was fairly natural,
the way she read poetry

290
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:30,658
seemed to have a rhythm
and a melody to it.

291
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:36,503
So it was very easy to attach
chords and rhythm underneath it.

292
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:43,378
# oh, she looks so good,
oh, she looks so fine

293
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:50,288
# and I got this crazy feeling
and then I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine

294
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:55,088
And having grown up with rock 'n roll,
those three classic chords,

295
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:59,659
we gravitated toward that.

296
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:06,510
It was fun, I mean, we enjoyed
the sense of twisting this form.

297
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,787
# and her name is,
and her name is,

298
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:20,955
# G-L-O-R-I-A

299
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,096
Patti Smith was absolutely astonishing.

300
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:35,189
She was absolutely vital
to laying the foundations of punk.

301
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:40,116
Her voice, her clothes,
her stage presence, her movements.

302
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:42,569
She was almost like a freestyle rapper.

303
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:54,363
The sentiment she was voicing

304
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:58,042
'Jesus died for somebody's
sins but not mine',

305
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:07,843
# Jesus died for somebody's sins

306
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,232
# but not mine.

307
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:16,170
Absolutely iconic imagery.

308
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,492
It had a street realism
that was unmistakably punk,

309
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:22,890
couldn't be anything else.

310
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,632
The Patti Smith band
recorded their first album

311
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:32,131
at the studios immortalised by
Jimmy Hendrix', 'Electric Lady',

312
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:33,986
in Greenwich Village.

313
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,704
They asked the Velvet Underground's
John Cale, to produce the record.

314
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:44,815
It was a punk spirit which informed
the song at the heart of the album,

315
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:45,710
'Horses'.

316
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:52,305
# ...suddenly Johnny gets the feeling
he's being surrounded by

317
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:56,231
# Horses, horses, horses, horses

318
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:59,840
Is it a punk song?
Well, it's got three chords.

319
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:06,281
Because they were
really easy to pulse.

320
00:22:06,717 --> 00:22:10,783
You could just go underneath and
it would kind of provide a soundtrack.

321
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:14,507
You could talk over it,
sing over it,

322
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:16,840
slow it down,

323
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,959
and then you could get really fast.

324
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:27,215
And it allowed the song to travel.

325
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:33,992
# Do you know how to pony
like Bony Maroney

326
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:39,031
It builds, it even changes rhythms
from like sort of a shuffle feel

327
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:46,535
to that sort of garage... band's
straight four and four feeling.

328
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,480
There is no syncopation.

329
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,135
It's not funky.

330
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,724
It's very, you know...

331
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:55,595
made by honkeys for honkeys, you know.

332
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,764
# ...pen knives and jack knives and

333
00:22:58,964 --> 00:22:59,596
# Switch blades...

334
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:02,351
'Horses', when it was released,
had an immediate impact.

335
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,879
The album cover with photography
by Robert Mapplethorpe,

336
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:08,840
was something quite new
in the iconography of rock.

337
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,111
She's wearing a man's shirt,

338
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:13,460
she's got a man's jacket
over her shoulder,

339
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,251
her tie is loosened.

340
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:18,173
She's very... extremely slender.

341
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,879
It was a shock at that time
to see a woman be proudly a woman

342
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:24,692
and yet so androgynous.

343
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:29,658
And not caring whether she was
gratifying of traditional...

344
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:33,981
male expectations of what a woman
needs to be to be sexy.

345
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,254
# ...a place called space

346
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:39,331
# It's a pretty little place...

347
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:43,298
The punk attitude of Patti Smith
was a revelation to those in the UK

348
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:45,150
looking for new idols.

349
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:48,161
It was utterly mindblowing.
It was uh...

350
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:53,081
Everything she sang about,
the way she released all the words,

351
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,817
the free flow, the strength of it,
the passion of it,

352
00:23:56,917 --> 00:24:00,563
and the utter contemporariness
of it all, it was like,

353
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:03,957
this is it, this is my soul on record.

354
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:10,741
In May, 1966, British fans were able
to see their heroin for the first time.

355
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:15,498
The Patti Smith band played a sellout
gig at the Roundhouse, in London.

356
00:24:19,102 --> 00:24:21,792
They recorded a session for the BBC.

357
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:24,336
# Horses, horses, horses, horses

358
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:26,307
# Coming in in all directions

359
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:31,984
# White, shining, silver studs
with their nose in flames

360
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:35,320
# He saw horses, horses, horses...

361
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:44,621
# Do you know how to pony
like Bony Maroney

362
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:51,494
# Do you know how to twist,
well it goes like this, it goes like this

363
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:53,832
# Baby mash potato...

364
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:57,770
They then accepted an invitation
to see the Sex Pistols

365
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,452
in their underground lair
at the 100 Club.

366
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:03,780
Someone, I think it might have been
Chrissie Hynde, said,

367
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,605
"You have to go down
and see this band.

368
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:07,952
"They're called the Sex Pistols."

369
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:10,688
I thought, "Wow! Interesting name."

370
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:14,975
We went down to this grungy,
underground pub,

371
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:21,013
I think it was the Club 100,
and they took the stage and they...

372
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:24,189
immediately, before they
even started playing,

373
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:28,048
you know, Johnny Rotten started saying,

374
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:30,902
"Oh! Did you go down at
the Roundhouse the other night?

375
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:33,972
"And see the hippies
shaking a tambourine?

376
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:37,097
"'orses, 'orses, 'orshit!"

377
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:40,216
And I thought,
"Man, that was a quick 15 minutes."

378
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:43,560
It's like we're already obsolete!

379
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:47,419
The taunting of these darlings
of New York art punk

380
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,290
made clear the differences
between the two cities.

381
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:55,132
The London bands were younger,
they had a lot less art theory,

382
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:59,410
they had, not necessarily
more politics, though some did,

383
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,209
but they had a lot more class rage.

384
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:10,383
No matter how unfocussed or
unexpressed, it was class rage.

385
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:15,077
Fundamentally, the New York punks
were bohemians, or aspired to be,

386
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:18,394
the London punks were "yobs",
or aspired to be.

387
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:26,246
The Sex Pistols took their one band
search and destroy mission nation wide

388
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:30,326
when they traveled to the Manchester
studios of Granada TV.

389
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,654
You can hear them warming up
in the background even now.

390
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:48,167
For their first TV appearance,
they played their second great anthem,

391
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:49,928
'Anarchy in the UK'.

392
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:53,524
# I am an antichrist

393
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:57,086
# I am an anarchist

394
00:26:57,286 --> 00:26:58,936
# Dont know what I want but

395
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:00,669
# I know how to get it

396
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:05,654
# I wanna destroy the passer by cos I

397
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:09,008
# I wanna be anarchy!

398
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,876
Lydon's performance
was driven by cold fury.

399
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:14,860
His lyrics, a brutal expression of rage.

400
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,605
# Anarchy for the UK

401
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:25,197
# It's coming sometime and maybe

402
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:28,745
# I give a wrong time stop a traffic line

403
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:30,708
# Your future dream...

404
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,876
I was an angry young man,
I still am probably,

405
00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:35,247
an angry old man.

406
00:27:35,347 --> 00:27:37,197
You're not gonna take
that away from me.

407
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:41,697
I don't think my feelings about
how society's downtrodden

408
00:27:41,797 --> 00:27:43,898
my kind of working class people,

409
00:27:43,998 --> 00:27:46,157
I don't think those
are false emotions at all.

410
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:49,520
It's not put on,
there's no airs and graces about it.

411
00:27:50,363 --> 00:27:54,023
We suffer, and you can
fuck off for it!

412
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:09,270
# How many ways to get what you want

413
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,809
# I use the best I use the rest

414
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:21,370
# I use the enemy I use anarchy cos I

415
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:29,132
# I wanna be anarchy!

416
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:35,246
When the Pistols appeared on that
program playing 'Anarchy in the UK',

417
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:39,987
it seemed almost inconceivable
that the performance

418
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:42,935
was gonna stay inside the TV set.

419
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:47,701
It was like Rotten was gonna crawl out
the screen and into your living room,

420
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:50,311
and be right there
in the room with you.

421
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:57,317
It was one of the most utterly
immediate things I've ever seen on TV.

422
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:58,665
# ...the IRA

423
00:28:58,865 --> 00:29:03,570
# I thought it was the UK or just

424
00:29:05,024 --> 00:29:09,897
# Another country

425
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:15,060
'Anarchy in the UK' singalled a real
intent to take on the rock establishment.

426
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:21,018
It's anarchy in the UK,
and so that shows an ambition.

427
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:24,414
Here was a group
that was not afraid to say,

428
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:28,059
"Right, we are going nation wide.

429
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,887
"This is it. This is about
the whole of the country.

430
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:35,826
"It's not just about a couple of clubs
and a couple of hundred kids in London,

431
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:39,950
"or Manchester or whatever. It's
actually, this is about the whole country."

432
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,799
Now, in the summer of 1976,
in London and beyond,

433
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,158
there was an explosion of creativity.

434
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:51,252
Brian James, playing with his new band,

435
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:53,932
'The Damned', noticed
something in the air.

436
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:57,233
It was a growing thing,
you'd see like...

437
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,078
first of all there'd
be like a few people,

438
00:29:59,178 --> 00:30:01,015
and you'd talk to them
after the gig, you know,

439
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:02,148
and stuff like that.

440
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:04,972
And then, the next day you'd see them,
and there'd be another couple.

441
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:06,576
And it would be the same
out in the streets.

442
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:09,717
There'd be maybe one punk
amongst all this sea of long hair.

443
00:30:09,817 --> 00:30:11,345
And then there'd be a few more.

444
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:14,804
And then, just gradually built
and built and built

445
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:16,815
and you'd see people
making their own clothes,

446
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,959
which was the cool thing,
and they made their own statements.

447
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,301
You know, sort of living out
their fantasies, if you like.

448
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:26,555
That was the cool thing about it.
That was a very, very cool thing.

449
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:28,967
The audience become part
of the whole show,

450
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:32,134
become part of the whole event,
you know, the experience.

451
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:36,258
Punk was taking rock back
to where it belonged.

452
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:40,378
It was about self interpretation,
empowerment, individuality.

453
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:41,923
Doing your own thing...

454
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:44,694
I can't tell you how much
this DIY thing,

455
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:46,914
how important it was.
I mean, it worked for me.

456
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:50,351
I reinvented myself through
the whole punk-rock thing.

457
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:52,876
When it kicked off and everybody's
picking up a guitar,

458
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,009
I wanted to pick up
something too, but...

459
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:59,196
very quickly the stage was full up,
so I picked up a super-8 camera

460
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:01,223
and reinvented myself as a film maker.

461
00:31:01,323 --> 00:31:04,395
And super-8 films, they only
lasted about three minutes,

462
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,106
and luckily for me, everything
the punks had to say,

463
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:08,460
fitted into three minutes.

464
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,272
Even when I interviewed them,
they usually ran out of things

465
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:11,721
after about 2 and a half minutes.

466
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:14,784
So it was hard and
fast and stripped down.

467
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,693
Bands began to form outside London,

468
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:25,063
'The Buzzcocks' in Manchester now proved
that you could take this DIY approach

469
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:30,845
and apply, beyond fashion and street
culture, to make punk's first DIY record.

470
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:35,884
The recording was...

471
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:40,340
I don't know, I could believe
we did it in half an hour.

472
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:45,252
My memory is the overall budget
for the whole thing was...

473
00:31:46,263 --> 00:31:49,269
everything was about 500 quid.

474
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:52,516
It wasn't intended to be
a statement or anything,

475
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:57,565
but it adhered the principles
of what punk was.

476
00:31:58,004 --> 00:31:59,239
And that was...

477
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:02,280
if you can do it yourself,
then what's stopping you?

478
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,794
And that because it's not polished,
it's not pristine and perfect

479
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:08,962
it doesn't mean it's not any good.

480
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:10,609
In fact it could have its own quality.

481
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:16,787
That being imperfect
it has more character, more life.

482
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:19,908
One Buzzcocks' song,

483
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:23,637
with its ironic, playful twist
on punk's taste for alienation,

484
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:25,031
became a classic.

485
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,362
# Yeah - well - I say what I mean

486
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,492
# I say what comes to my mind

487
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:33,661
# because I never get around to things

488
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:35,704
# I live a straight - straight line

489
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,900
# You know me - I'm acting dumb

490
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:40,618
# you know the scene - very humdrum

491
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:43,952
# Boredom - boredom

492
00:32:45,357 --> 00:32:46,641
# Boredom

493
00:32:50,193 --> 00:32:55,469
Well, 'Boredom' was a...

494
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,365
that was gonna be a safe topic.

495
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:03,590
That would be in style,
that was to be the kind of thing

496
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,609
one would think about,
and one would write about.

497
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,295
# Boredom, boredom... boredom.

498
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:16,016
We wanted it not to be
pleasant and easy listening,

499
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:18,285
but to be a bit challenging in a way.

500
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:23,557
I would just play around with things
and see what sounded right.

501
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:26,441
# Because my future ain't what it was

502
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:28,107
# well I think I know
the words that I mean

503
00:33:28,142 --> 00:33:30,524
'Boredom' was sophisticated,

504
00:33:30,724 --> 00:33:34,414
'Boredom' had stops in it.
The song stopped

505
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:37,093
and we hadn't had that before.

506
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:46,395
When it came to the guitar solo,

507
00:33:46,495 --> 00:33:49,345
I wanted a parody of a guitar solo.

508
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:50,922
So instead of playing
lots and lots of notes

509
00:33:51,022 --> 00:33:52,933
I just repeated the same tune.

510
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:54,896
Doing...

511
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:59,541
A guitar solo which
didn't rock all the rolls

512
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:01,569
of what a guitar solo
was supposed to be.

513
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:05,621
But it works because
of the idea of boredom,

514
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:07,282
having something which is...

515
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:11,119
adds nothing to it at all,
which goes on and on and on...

516
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:14,688
It fitted in with that concept.

517
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:23,436
The decisive influence on the early sound
of band like Buzzcocks in the UK,

518
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:27,173
was the revved up minimalism
of The Ramones in NY.

519
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:37,246
The Ramones recorded their
first album in a matter of days

520
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:40,075
at a studio in Radio City Music Hall.

521
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:44,251
That was done quickly, inexpensively,

522
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:48,689
and it sort of suited
our ways of working anyway.

523
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:51,546
With the impatience of the band
and everything so...

524
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:55,302
In a way it lent itself to the sort of

525
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:59,899
lo-fi interesting
quality of what it became.

526
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:03,288
So the first album is sort of
a statement of its own.

527
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,775
The first song on the album
was one of the greatest

528
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,820
to come out of this punk uprising.

529
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:09,670
'Blitzkrieg Bop'

530
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,995
Take it Diddy.

531
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:29,151
I was walking down the street

532
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:32,756
and it just occurred to me, it'd be
great if The Ramones had a chant song.

533
00:35:33,636 --> 00:35:40,608
# Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go

534
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,492
# They're forming in straight line

535
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:45,120
# They're going through a tight wind

536
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,247
# The kids are losing their minds

537
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:48,644
# The Blitzkrieg Bop

538
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,010
# They're piling in the back seat

539
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:54,254
# They're generating steam heat

540
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:56,593
# Pulsating to the back beat

541
00:35:56,694 --> 00:35:58,065
# The Blitzkrieg Bop

542
00:35:58,912 --> 00:36:00,887
I was in this loft actually.

543
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,290
It happened in this loft.
I was...

544
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:05,289
I was playing Joy's guitar,

545
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:09,338
and as I was playing it, I just started
playing 'Blitzkrieg Bop',

546
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:11,466
it just came up to me...
it just came to me.

547
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:16,612
And that night I went home
and I wrote the song.

548
00:36:16,712 --> 00:36:19,037
I put together the 'Hey ho, let's go'
with that,

549
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:22,119
and I took it to the next rehearsal.

550
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:23,683
And that was 'Blitkrieg Bop'.

551
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:24,823
# Pulsating to the back beat

552
00:36:24,923 --> 00:36:26,342
# The Blitzkrieg Bop

553
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:31,238
Songs like 'Blitzkrieg Bop' had
immediate appeal to bands forming

554
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:33,468
during the UK summer of punk.

555
00:36:34,086 --> 00:36:37,153
It was like that kind of...
like a rallying call.

556
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:39,607
You know, "Hey ho, let's go".

557
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:47,456
Not really philosophical lyrics,
but it was about doing things.

558
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:50,585
Talking about punk being
about action,

559
00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:53,958
really rather than just... theorising.

560
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:54,990
# The Blitzkrieg Bop

561
00:36:56,402 --> 00:37:01,095
# Hey ho, let's go

562
00:37:06,947 --> 00:37:08,696
When we first heard
The Ramones' album,

563
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:11,938
how influential that was, because
it was just like totally...

564
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:19,125
like... really short songs,
really hard attack, no nonsense.

565
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:22,651
It was just like cut down
bare to the bone, you know,

566
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:25,214
and that was inspiring.

567
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,092
Inspired by the stripped down
formula of The Ramones,

568
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:33,433
The Clash played their first gigs.

569
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:38,504
# They offered me the office,
offered me the shop

570
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:43,639
# They said I better
take anything they got

571
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,649
# Do you wanna make tea at the BBC?

572
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,706
# Do you wanna be,
do really wanna be a cop?

573
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:53,475
They looked great as
a three man frontline.

574
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:55,209
Strummer's a great front man...

575
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:57,648
as good as Lydon.

576
00:37:57,748 --> 00:38:01,350
So visually very strong,
and it was very hard and fast.

577
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:05,271
One 2 minute wonder after another.

578
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:08,653
'What's my name', 'Cheat',
'Career opportunities'...

579
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,005
just really good.

580
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:12,579
Fantastic song.

581
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:15,029
# I hate the civil service rules

582
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:18,901
# And I won't open letter bombs for you

583
00:38:20,023 --> 00:38:22,734
# Career opportunities
are the ones that never knock

584
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:25,335
# Every job they offer you
is to keep out the dock

585
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:28,121
# Career opportunities,
the ones that never knock

586
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,613
Although The Clash took
inspiration from New York,

587
00:38:30,713 --> 00:38:33,565
they took their music
in a completely new direction.

588
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:36,890
They created a punk that
was a kind of protest music,

589
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,598
engaged with the world.

590
00:38:39,494 --> 00:38:44,176
While John Lydon, Johnny Rotten,
had a rage against the system,

591
00:38:44,276 --> 00:38:46,094
Joe Strummer had a more evolved,

592
00:38:46,194 --> 00:38:49,249
more finely tuned
sort of political awareness.

593
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:53,405
He regarded his ancestors
as people like Woody Guthrie.

594
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:55,897
He regarded himself as a leftist.

595
00:38:55,997 --> 00:38:59,507
Whereas John probably regarded
himself as a 'Johnnist'.

596
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:02,867
# Career opportunities,
the ones that never knock

597
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:05,609
I think the difference between us
and the Pistols was that

598
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:11,030
they had their massive impact
but they didn't offer the same kind of

599
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,367
hope that we did.

600
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:17,756
The Clash wrote songs
of experience.

601
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:20,615
Near where they were living
in West London,

602
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:23,937
summer's end, 1976,
the Notting Hill Carnival

603
00:39:24,037 --> 00:39:27,003
ended with fighting between
black youth and the Police.

604
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:29,540
Joe Strummer and Paul Simenon
from the band,

605
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,977
were caught up in the mayhem.

606
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,600
So The Clash sat down and wrote
a song inspired by the incident:

607
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,136
'White Riot'.

608
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,179
We was down there, me and him,

609
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:41,009
we got searched by policemen,

610
00:39:41,722 --> 00:39:43,000
looking for bricks.

611
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,358
And then later on we got
searched by Rasta

612
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,479
looking for pound notes
in our pockets, so...

613
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:50,630
And all we had was bricks and bottles.

614
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:56,717
# White riot, I want a riot

615
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:58,795
# White riot, a riot of my own

616
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:01,240
# White riot, I want a riot

617
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,490
# White riot, a riot of my own

618
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,750
# Black man gotta lot a problems

619
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:08,004
# But they don't mind throwing a brick

620
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,120
# White people go to school

621
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,638
# Where they teach you how to be thick

622
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:14,398
# An' everybody's doing

623
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,799
# Just what they're told to

624
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:19,164
# An' nobody wants

625
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:22,122
# To go to jail!

626
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:24,817
# White riot, I want a riot

627
00:40:24,817 --> 00:40:26,795
# White riot, a riot of my own

628
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:29,240
# White riot, I want a riot

629
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,256
# White riot, a riot of my own

630
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:32,799
The song was about

631
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:36,633
white people getting up
and doing it for themselves, because...

632
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:40,993
their black neighbours were doing
it for themselves, and so it was...

633
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:43,888
the riots and whatever.
So it was time for...

634
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:47,690
the white people to get on
with their own situation,

635
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,462
which I suppose was
the beginning of the punk thing.

636
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:52,817
# White riot, I want a riot

637
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,931
# White riot, a riot of my own

638
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:57,163
# White riot, I want a riot

639
00:40:57,263 --> 00:40:58,917
# White riot

640
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,868
# I do...

641
00:41:08,124 --> 00:41:10,273
# White riot, I want a riot

642
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:12,362
# White riot, a riot of my own

643
00:41:12,462 --> 00:41:14,633
# White riot, I want a riot

644
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,736
# White riot, a riot of my own

645
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:24,735
But late in 1976, outrage and hype

646
00:41:24,835 --> 00:41:27,646
threatened to destroy the achievements
of the early punk groups.

647
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:32,305
The Sex Pistols were booked to appear
live on an early evening news show.

648
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:37,263
- Now, I want to know one thing.
- What?

649
00:41:37,363 --> 00:41:39,822
Are you serious or just
trying to make me laugh?

650
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:40,842
No, it's all gone. Gone.

651
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:41,646
- Really?
- Yeah.

652
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:43,114
No, but I mean about
what you're doing.

653
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:45,166
- Oh, yeah.
- You are serious?

654
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:48,500
Beethoven, Mozart,
Bach have all died...

655
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,445
- They're all heroes of ours, ain't they?
- Really? What do you say, sir?

656
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:54,117
- They're wonderful people.
- Are they?

657
00:41:54,217 --> 00:41:56,902
- Oh, yes. They really turn us on.
- But they're dead!

658
00:41:57,002 --> 00:41:58,658
Well suppose they turn
other people on.

659
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:02,074
- That's just their tough shit.
- It's what?

660
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:03,818
Nothing, a rude word.

661
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:05,094
Next question.

662
00:42:05,294 --> 00:42:07,396
No, no. What was the rude word?

663
00:42:07,596 --> 00:42:08,728
Shit.

664
00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:13,334
I accidentally took some amphetamine
sulfate two days before,

665
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:14,818
I didn't mean to...

666
00:42:16,394 --> 00:42:19,319
And, I'm speeding up my nut
and so, you know,

667
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:21,430
the whole thing was tense to me

668
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,739
and I was goaded into
swearing the 'shit' word.

669
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,624
Was it really? Good Heavens!
You frighten me to death.

670
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:30,309
- Oh alright, Siegfried...
- What about you, girls, behind?

671
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:34,232
Enjoying the occasion
was soon to be Banshee, Siouxsie Sioux.

672
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:36,303
Are you worried or are you
just enjoying yourself?

673
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:37,318
Enjoying myself.

674
00:42:37,418 --> 00:42:38,188
- Are you?
- Yeah.

675
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:39,452
So I thought you were...

676
00:42:39,552 --> 00:42:41,604
- I always wanted to meet you.
- Did you really?

677
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:42,931
We'll meet afterwards, shall we?

678
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:45,149
You dirty sod.

679
00:42:45,658 --> 00:42:47,227
You dirty old man!

680
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:48,663
Keep going, chief.
Keep going.

681
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,696
Go on, you've got another
five seconds, say something outrageous.

682
00:42:52,796 --> 00:42:54,107
You dirty bastard!

683
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:56,602
You dirty fucker!

684
00:42:56,703 --> 00:42:57,797
What a clever boy!

685
00:42:57,892 --> 00:42:58,746
What a fucking rotter.

686
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:00,089
Well, that's it for tonight.

687
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:04,594
Well, it did make us popular...

688
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:08,140
Well, no, it made us
hugely unpopular,

689
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,950
which was much more fun.

690
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,263
But it wasn't undeliberate,
all right?

691
00:43:12,363 --> 00:43:14,485
And in the chaos of it,
somehow or other,

692
00:43:14,585 --> 00:43:16,640
whatever message we had, got out.

693
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,178
The word's out now,
the game's up.

694
00:43:19,278 --> 00:43:21,074
The phoneys can leave the stage

695
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:23,053
'cause the real deal is about
to enter the world.

696
00:43:23,153 --> 00:43:24,191
And that's how it was.

697
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,662
The Sex Pistols,
supported by The Clash,

698
00:43:27,762 --> 00:43:30,177
already had a nation wide
tour scheduled.

699
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,411
Now, there was real trouble.

700
00:43:33,123 --> 00:43:34,794
Fleet Street were now chasing us.

701
00:43:34,894 --> 00:43:37,148
And it just... just changed.

702
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:40,380
And then, a day or two later,
we run off on the 'Anarchy Tour'

703
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,301
and we were pursued up and down
across the Penines

704
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,669
by a flotilla of press cars.

705
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:49,309
It was stupid.

706
00:43:49,954 --> 00:43:53,770
Along with tabloid frenzy,
there was moral outrage and revulsion.

707
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:57,670
I think it's degrading and disgusting

708
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,671
for our children
to hear and see such things.

709
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,487
Local worthies did their best
to put a stop to this punk nonsense.

710
00:44:04,587 --> 00:44:09,372
This protest is to make Wales know,
to have the people of this town know

711
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:11,105
that we do protest.

712
00:44:11,205 --> 00:44:12,867
The thing is they're outside, freezing.

713
00:44:15,713 --> 00:44:18,873
For a clean living, holy living,
and proud living.

714
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:20,590
They're entitled to do
what they want.

715
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:25,383
I think we had like 16 dates
booked and...

716
00:44:25,483 --> 00:44:30,781
as we went up the motorway
the dates got less and less.

717
00:44:30,881 --> 00:44:33,733
And I think we ended up
doing only four.

718
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,085
Into 1977, an unhappy
Glen Matlock left the group.

719
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:47,503
He was replaced by Sid Vicious.

720
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:51,806
Sid was the perfect cartoon punk
in terms of standing there

721
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:57,915
in his leather jacket, pulling
comic angry faces in photographs.

722
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:01,971
After they got rid of Glen
they had some great photos taken

723
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:05,394
but they never again
wrote a decent song.

724
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,325
Increasingly unable to play live,

725
00:45:07,425 --> 00:45:11,199
the revamped Pistols recorded the last
great song writing collaboration

726
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:12,786
between Matlock and Rotten.

727
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,715
# God save the queen

728
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:18,939
# The fascist regime

729
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:22,634
# They made you a moron

730
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:25,266
# Potential H-bomb

731
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,680
'God Save the Queen' is just a rant.

732
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:33,794
It's chorusless but it seems to be...

733
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,228
a proper song, but it ain't.

734
00:45:36,338 --> 00:45:37,485
And I like that.

735
00:45:37,585 --> 00:45:39,707
Rules are for fools.

736
00:45:39,729 --> 00:45:42,342
# Don't be told what you want

737
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:44,121
# Don't be told what you need

738
00:45:44,156 --> 00:45:47,954
'God save the Queen' was released during
the summer of the Queen's Silver Jubilee,

739
00:45:48,054 --> 00:45:51,343
promoted by a brilliantly
anarchic marketing campaign.

740
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:53,987
# God save the queen

741
00:45:55,061 --> 00:45:57,175
# We mean it man

742
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:00,225
With all that build-up,
with all that feeling,

743
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:03,307
it's incredibly exciting,
it's incredibly well drilled.

744
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:05,150
Everybody is...
on it like that.

745
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,193
# God save the Queen,

746
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:10,888
# for tourists are money

747
00:46:12,405 --> 00:46:14,046
And it has just fantastic lyrics.

748
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:18,494
'England's dreaming' and
'Tourist's are money',

749
00:46:18,594 --> 00:46:19,655
and 'the mad parade'.

750
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:20,845
Wonderful lyrics.

751
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:25,341
There was one inspired
publicity stunt,

752
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:29,364
a boat trip on the Thames the evening
of the Jubilee celebrations.

753
00:46:30,075 --> 00:46:32,117
We did know what we were up to.

754
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:37,272
Singing 'Anarchy' and 'God Save the Queen'
outside the Houses of Parliament

755
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:39,939
as loud and raucous as you like...

756
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:42,876
was a good thing.

757
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,503
A good statement.

758
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:48,319
A good day out in Rotten World.

759
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:57,582
And then it has this rather desolate

760
00:46:57,682 --> 00:47:01,178
and very emotional chant
of 'No future' at the end,

761
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:02,474
where the rest of the band join in.

762
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:05,286
And that was kind of
very touching as well.

763
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:09,254
# And England's dreaming

764
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:13,499
# No future

765
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,708
# No future

766
00:47:16,824 --> 00:47:21,621
# No future for you

767
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:24,859
These were subjects never
discussed before.

768
00:47:25,624 --> 00:47:28,672
To even think of the Royal Family
as subject matter in a song

769
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:31,956
in any way but lauding
their wonderfulness,

770
00:47:32,056 --> 00:47:35,411
was... I don't know,
considered a crime.

771
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:01,903
Into 1977, punk's spirit of adventure
was picked up by bands

772
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:04,022
fronted by women,
like Siouxsie Sioux,

773
00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:06,317
who'd been close
to the first punk pioneers.

774
00:48:06,765 --> 00:48:08,907
The whole point about
punk for me was...

775
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:10,303
it had to be new.

776
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:13,647
Something new. Something
that hadn't been done before.

777
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:16,795
As soon as you saw Siouxsie
and the Banshees or The Slits...

778
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,989
this is something new.

779
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:21,245
No girls had made that
kind of noise before.

780
00:48:22,593 --> 00:48:24,150
# He is a boy

781
00:48:25,171 --> 00:48:27,204
# He's very thin

782
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:29,763
# Until tomorrow

783
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:31,069
# Took heroin

784
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,189
# Don't like himself...

785
00:48:32,224 --> 00:48:35,502
Viv Albertine, so inspired
by the example of Patti Smith,

786
00:48:35,602 --> 00:48:37,511
now had the chance
to do it herself,

787
00:48:37,611 --> 00:48:39,822
with the all-girl band
The Slits.

788
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:42,540
It didn't matter in the early days
that we couldn't play.

789
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,260
It just mattered that
you had the passion...

790
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,141
And we could play well enough
just to all start at the same time.

791
00:48:48,241 --> 00:48:50,084
We didn't play well enough
to all finish at the same time.

792
00:48:50,184 --> 00:48:53,856
We all looked great, we hammered away,
we shouted what we...

793
00:48:53,956 --> 00:48:55,201
what we wanted to say and...

794
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:56,847
The energy was absolutely wild.

795
00:48:56,947 --> 00:48:59,818
We just made it up as we went along
and each time we learnt a new chord

796
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,728
we'd put it in a new song
and write a new song about it...

797
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:03,417
around the chord.

798
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,615
The Slits were willing to embrace
new sounds and rhythms.

799
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,658
# Typical girls get upset to quickly

800
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:18,586
# Typical girls can't
control themselves

801
00:49:18,686 --> 00:49:20,705
# Typical girls...

802
00:49:20,811 --> 00:49:24,045
The boy bands in punk
were very much rock music,

803
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:28,442
you know, 4/4 time,
based on 12 bar blues rhythm,

804
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:30,659
and we felt very much that as girls

805
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,510
we didn't feel this rigid
kind of rhythm within us.

806
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:36,516
We felt much more... we wanted
to get across our feminine rhythms.

807
00:49:36,616 --> 00:49:40,292
'Typical Girls' was this weird
lolloping sort of rhythm but...

808
00:49:40,392 --> 00:49:42,665
that's what we felt
we wanted to get across.

809
00:49:42,765 --> 00:49:43,722
This is who we were, you know.

810
00:49:43,822 --> 00:49:46,768
Punk was open enough
to allow us to do that.

811
00:49:51,873 --> 00:49:57,137
Into 1978, the Sex Pistols, faced
with continuing problems in the UK,

812
00:49:57,237 --> 00:49:59,128
decided to break America.

813
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:01,584
To show the yanks
who were the real punks.

814
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:05,029
Instead, America broke the Pistols.

815
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:06,441
Photographer Bob Gruen,

816
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:09,600
was a witness to the band's
very public self destruction,

817
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,413
with Vicious the leading man.

818
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:15,217
I had decided not to be
in front of the stage.

819
00:50:15,317 --> 00:50:16,603
I tried to get on the side

820
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,610
and watch the action from
a little bit of distance,

821
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,119
'cause I didn't want to be in the...

822
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,263
the fray. It was like a battleground
in front of the band.

823
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:27,078
And one night I remember Sid

824
00:50:27,178 --> 00:50:30,921
had this interchange between
these girls in the front and...

825
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:33,745
at one point a girl kind of
motioned for him to come a little closer

826
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,377
and he leaned over and she punched
him right in the nose.

827
00:50:36,477 --> 00:50:40,633
And he had blood pouring out of
his nose and down his face and chest...

828
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:42,569
and a big smile on his face.

829
00:50:42,669 --> 00:50:44,050
Like he really enjoyed it.

830
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,637
I'd never seen anybody react that
way to being punched in the nose.

831
00:50:47,737 --> 00:50:51,044
And then he started taking the blood
and splashing it back at the girl,

832
00:50:51,144 --> 00:50:53,120
and she was
spitting it back at him and...

833
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,954
then the blood started to dry up and...

834
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,953
he went over to his amp and took
a bottle and he smashed on the amp

835
00:50:59,053 --> 00:51:00,746
and starting cutting his chest,

836
00:51:00,846 --> 00:51:04,460
basically to make more blood, I think,
to keep the game going.

837
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:11,686
They ended their last gig
in San Francisco playing 'No fun',

838
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:15,947
a nod to the godfathers of punk,
'Iggy Pop and the Stooges'.

839
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:22,774
You'll get one number and one number
only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard.

840
00:51:25,718 --> 00:51:27,593
This is 'No fun'.

841
00:51:29,622 --> 00:51:35,453
# No fun, my babe no fun

842
00:51:36,316 --> 00:51:41,910
# No fun, my babe no fun

843
00:51:43,408 --> 00:51:46,526
# No fun to be alone

844
00:51:46,726 --> 00:51:49,810
# Walking by my self

845
00:51:50,248 --> 00:51:52,962
# No fun to be alone

846
00:51:53,256 --> 00:51:59,210
# In love with nobody else

847
00:52:09,217 --> 00:52:13,802
# No, no fun, no fun

848
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:16,684
I suppose all of us felt
that it was no fun.

849
00:52:16,784 --> 00:52:19,535
It was really no fun at all.

850
00:52:19,635 --> 00:52:22,240
We really got
the pain of that song.

851
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,930
We took it to the extreme edge
of really no fun.

852
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,455
Oh, bollocks! Why should I carry on?

853
00:52:32,037 --> 00:52:36,091
This is really not fun...
and it wasn't.

854
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:39,111
# It's no fun at all

855
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,024
# No fun

856
00:53:08,202 --> 00:53:10,996
Ever get the feeling
you're being cheated?

857
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,271
Good night.

858
00:53:14,463 --> 00:53:17,073
At the very last gig, "ever get
the feeling you're being cheated?",

859
00:53:17,173 --> 00:53:21,218
was directed straight
at the whole world, including us.

860
00:53:21,391 --> 00:53:24,293
Because I was feeling
cheated by that point.

861
00:53:25,658 --> 00:53:28,067
By the time the Sex Pistols
finally broke up,

862
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:31,681
there was a feeling that punk had become
the very thing it had set out to destroy.

863
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:32,914
It was predicable,

864
00:53:33,014 --> 00:53:33,938
boring.

865
00:53:34,987 --> 00:53:38,696
Tired of this conformity,
Howard Devoto left Buzzcocks,

866
00:53:38,796 --> 00:53:40,821
but Pete Shelley stayed,

867
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:43,835
fusing punk attitude with a taste
for a good tune,

868
00:53:43,935 --> 00:53:45,495
to write the perfect
pop song.

869
00:53:45,595 --> 00:53:47,303
A new one from our next album,

870
00:53:47,403 --> 00:53:50,361
'Ever Fallen in Love
(with Someone You Shouldn't've)'

871
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:54,586
It wasn't ***

872
00:53:56,904 --> 00:53:58,390
It was just down to the songs,

873
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,738
let the songs have good melodies and...

874
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:02,876
that's fine.

875
00:54:03,146 --> 00:54:05,867
# You spurn my natural emotions

876
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:08,356
# You make me feel like dirt

877
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:09,625
# And I'm hurt

878
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:16,355
# And if I start a commotion

879
00:54:16,455 --> 00:54:18,892
# I run the risk of losing you

880
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:20,655
# And that's worse

881
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:26,524
# Ever fallen in love with someone

882
00:54:26,624 --> 00:54:27,890
# Ever fallen in love

883
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:29,263
# In love with someone

884
00:54:29,363 --> 00:54:30,619
# Ever fallen in love

885
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:33,976
# In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

886
00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:39,395
It was The Clash who tried
to keep punk honest

887
00:54:39,495 --> 00:54:43,692
remaining close to their fans and
continuing their political commitment.

888
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:46,750
But they were impatient
to move on musically.

889
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:48,509
We do the same thing...

890
00:54:48,609 --> 00:54:50,230
who wants to know...

891
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,603
after a while?

892
00:54:51,975 --> 00:54:54,272
It makes people sick
in the head to do that.

893
00:54:54,372 --> 00:54:57,820
So we have to always try new things

894
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:02,395
and like everyone's
a load of like sheep

895
00:55:02,495 --> 00:55:06,051
going, "It's horrible", or "It's nice".

896
00:55:06,718 --> 00:55:08,330
But they don't fucking know.

897
00:55:14,153 --> 00:55:17,117
The Clash decided
to explore a range of influences

898
00:55:17,217 --> 00:55:21,900
from rockabilly to reggae on their
1979 album, 'London Calling'.

899
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:25,931
# London calling and I don't wanna shout

900
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,317
# But while we were talking
I saw you nodding out

901
00:55:29,517 --> 00:55:32,726
# London calling,
see we ain't got no high

902
00:55:32,826 --> 00:55:36,228
# Except for that one
with the yellowy eyes

903
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:39,577
# The ice age is coming,
the sun's zooming in

904
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:45,676
It was really The Clash who having
begun as a defining punk band,

905
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:50,527
then attempted to see what else
they could turn their hands to,

906
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:58,574
apply their talent to a whole
other bunch of styles and influences,

907
00:55:58,674 --> 00:56:03,558
and demonstrated that
while you still have the punk gene,

908
00:56:03,658 --> 00:56:06,587
as long as you don't lose it,
you can take it anywhere.

909
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:10,046
By the time of 'London Calling',

910
00:56:10,146 --> 00:56:12,782
The Clash had traveled from
the extremeties of punk

911
00:56:12,882 --> 00:56:15,829
into the rock mainstream,
where they became for a while

912
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:17,842
the most important band in the world.

913
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:20,969
# The ice age is coming,
the sun's zooming in

914
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:24,210
# Meltdown expected,
the wheat is growing thin

915
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:27,579
# Engines stop running,
but I have no fear

916
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,931
# Cause London is drowning and I,
live by the river

917
00:56:46,158 --> 00:56:49,078
# London calling, yes,
I was there, too

918
00:56:49,178 --> 00:56:52,402
# An' you know what they said?
Well, some of it was true!

919
00:56:52,502 --> 00:56:55,823
# London calling
at the top of the dial

920
00:56:55,923 --> 00:56:59,382
# And after all this,
won't you give me a smile?

921
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:09,709
# I never felt so much alike,
like-a, like-a...

922
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:18,314
As for John Lydon,
after the Sex Pistols,

923
00:57:18,414 --> 00:57:21,571
punk's most provocative performer
formed a new band.

924
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:25,663
With 'Public Image' Lydon
moved into his post-punk future,

925
00:57:25,763 --> 00:57:28,253
with something more personal,
deliberately left field,

926
00:57:28,353 --> 00:57:30,264
surprisingly arty.

927
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:36,191
I loved the idea of just getting
into things without any rules at all.

928
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:38,816
Going to much madder sounds.

929
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:46,995
Infinite varieties of textures,
tones, drones, caterwauls.

930
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:48,812
Experiment.

931
00:57:48,823 --> 00:57:53,008
# Drive to the forest in a Japanese car

932
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:57,654
# The smell of rubber on concrete tar

933
00:57:58,524 --> 00:58:02,301
# Hindsight does me no good

934
00:58:02,401 --> 00:58:05,240
# Standing naked
in the back of the woods

935
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:15,156
# The cassette played pop tones

936
00:58:16,217 --> 00:58:20,162
This was music created
in punk's true spirit of liberation,

937
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:22,196
which guaranteed that from now on

938
00:58:22,296 --> 00:58:25,018
anything was possible
in rock music.

939
00:58:28,594 --> 00:58:31,950
# I can't forget
the impression you made

940
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:36,123
# You left a hole
in the back of my head

941
00:58:36,158 --> 00:58:38,094
Next week on
'Seven Ages of Rock',

942
00:58:38,194 --> 00:58:41,741
